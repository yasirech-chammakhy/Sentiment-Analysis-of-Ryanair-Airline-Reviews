0,K Vernon," Frankfurt Hahn to Vilnius return. Incredible experience. What I was mostly impressed with is ultimate efficiency of Ryanair, every process is executed very fast. No enormous queues anywhere - check-in, boarding/disembarkation and baggage claim were executed super quickly, none of these took more than 10 mins - which is very often a disaster when choosing ""legacy"" airlines. (In addition to that, there were no queues at security control as well at both HHN and VNO - but it's out of airline's responsibility). The cabin crew were polite and helpful, but not annoying - also an excellent job done. And - last but not least - of course, very reasonable fares. The only trouble was that the flight was slightly late (~20 mins) in both directions so I had doubts if I will be able to catch the bus for the following parts of my trip, but luckily everything went smoothly. Will definitely choose Ryanair for my future trips.",Economy Class,y,2023-04-24,frankfurt hahn vilnius return incredible experience mostly impressed ultimate efficiency ryanair every process executed fast enormous queue anywhere check boarding disembarkation baggage claim executed super quickly none took min often disaster choosing legacy airline addition queue security control well hhn vno airline responsibility cabin crew polite helpful annoying also excellent job done last least course reasonable fare trouble flight slightly late min direction doubt able catch bus following part trip luckily everything went smoothly definitely choose ryanair future trip,0.9295,Positive,584

3,U Ali,"  I had thought Ryanair would have improved over the years, but I was completely wrong. The cheap flights are completely offset by added charges. Firstly with bags, the size they provide as acceptable cabin bags are miniscule - barely enough to fit a days worth of clothes and items - so we purchased a cabin bag. The cabin bag they allow is the size of a usual carry on; the small wheeled suitcases so many people use. However when we got to check in, everyone with us (after the priority boarding) had these suitcases with no problem? We paid to have a bag checked in, when everyone else carried theirs on with no problem. That was £55 extra. We then had to pay to sit next to each other, as I was travelling with my partner. We paid for this on one flight, and for the return flight we checked in as soon as online check in was open. Even though there were only a couple of seats already booked and the entire plane was empty, it deliberately seated us far apart in order to make us pay more. When it says they cannot guarantee you will be seated next to each other, take it to mean they will deliberately seat you far apart in order to get more money from you. Finally on the flight, having a flight attendant scream right next to you, as they yell at their colleague at the other end of the plane was interesting. Even more so was the aggressive way they do anything. I walk using a walking aid, and I called up to check this was ok before I boarded. After being told it was ok and that I would be able to keep the walking aid between my legs, an attendant roughly grabbed it on the flight and shoved it into an already full overhead locker, and then slammed it shut several times until it closed. This cracked and damaged the walking aid and I've now had to purchase another. When I submitted a complaint about this, I was told I needed to have filled in a particular form at the airport. I have never had an attendant damage the items I use to walk around before, and at no point does it say that if anything is damaged you need to fill in a form at the airport. I was then stuck in a loop of calling in to discuss this issue, being told to reply to an email and then being told they would do nothing as this form was not filled in. Ryanair remains a predatory airline - you will not pay the low amount you see online. Avoid them, and give your money to any of the other budget airlines if you're looking to save money.

9,Jilian Nizwantowski,"  I always try to find the cheapest flight to wherever I need to go, and it always ends up being with Ryanair. But I will say, no matter what the price is this airline is awful. The bag requirements for baggage under the seat is way too small. My husband and I have fit numerous “oversized” bags under the seat perfectly fine, but once in a while they will charge us almost €50 for the baggage. That is way over priced for even what the app charges for an extra bag. Also again, it’s ridiculous that I pack super light but they consider my bag too big just because it’s a hiking bag. It’s hard finding other airlines to fly and Ryanair is the most convenient one all the time but man do I hate flying with them. Also the staff when checking into the flight during boarding is always awful and so rude.

They wouldn't give me the time to reorganize my backpack to have my purse fit into it, threatening me that I would miss my flight. I'm wondering if they get a premium for trying to milk extra money from their customers. They also forced me to put check in my backpack with my laptop in it.

We were due to fly to Dublin at 10 so we’re loaded on the plane for an 11 flight not to much of a problem. We took our seats to be informed that there was a delay due to defrosting the aircraft, first off told 30 mins, then we were next in the queue, then told we were waiting for air traffic then told again waiting for defrosting, this went on for an hour and a half then they unloaded some passengers who were fed up with the delay and lies. We were then told we would be going soon. Asked if there was any chance of a drink and told they didn’t have any then told I could have a bottle of water but it would cost me to which I laughed. We had a connection to Rome at 15.30 hrs we were told that they had contacted Aer Lingus to inform them we were on our way we then took off at 13.45 on arrival at Dublin we had missed our connecting flight and Aer Lingus knew nothing of this and we’re informed by the very helpful Ryanair desk it was nothing to do with them.

17,Emma-Jayne Cullen,"  I will never again book with Ryanair - the poorest customer service I have ever received in my life. We booked our flights out to Pisa (for our Wedding this August - 11 months later) last Sept and just 2 weeks after booking they changed our flights by 5.5 hrs going out and 7 hrs coming back. To add insult we paid for their most expensive flights to get good flight times to make the most of our Wedding holiday, as did 40+ of our guests too; and they put us onto their cheapest ‘night flights’ that are still selling online now dirt cheap. It’s 4.5 months on since they changed our online booking (no notification, we just found by fluke by logging in), but when we rang they said they cannot change the flight until it is confirmed then we will ‘receive an e-mail’ to be able to request a refund or accept the new flights. I call every month and e-mail every month but I get the same text book answer ‘you can change your flights when you receive your e-mail of the change, which could be up until 3 months prior to your flight date’ - So Ryanair's customer service answer is wait 6 months until all other flight prices are sky high so we can’t afford to request a refund and must accept our overly inflated cost of night flights, as we bought them under false pretenses.

My suitcase was very small, undersized and fit under the seat. Even so, they made me pay for an extra suitcase. The biggest problem was that I was not given a receipt and payment was made over the phone. They forced me to give my card details to a supposed telephone employee.  They gave me the phone and said I had to give my card details otherwise I would have to leave my suitcase there. In addition to not having received any receipt as proof of payment, they kept my card details which should have been confidential. This is illegal.

50,Diogo Freitas," Ryanair cabin crew makes me worried as a passenger, they seem to be under enormous pressure, anxious, worried, sometimes with unnecessarily alarmed speech, other times with too slow or prostrate diction. The company tries to save on everything even when the passenger asks for a simple receipt for the service provided. The Irish authorities need to be brought to the attention of the EU to comply with consumer rights, particularly in terms of taxation. While Ryanair is largely responsible for stimulating the local economy, the social, tax and environmental cost is also very high. I will continue to complain to the Portuguese Tax Authority for this company to fulfil its obligations, not least because it is very keen to take advantage of national financial funds when available.

51,S Anna,"  When we boarded the aircraft they made us wait over an hour as they found a fault and decided to do a check…the check should have been done before letting people board the aircraft. Firstly we were told that a new aircraft will be ready by 18:00 (the flight was at 14:30). At 18:00 we were told to wait till 21:35, at 21:35 we were told to wait till 3:30AM which after we were asked to wait till 6:10am, 6:10 am there was still no aircraft ready. I asked for an expenses form and no one could help me, the website would not allow me to change my flight free of charge like the email from Ryanair stated and when I asked a staff member for help once again their response was “sorry we can’t help you”, After 10 hours of delay I asked the staff for help with a hotel and their response once again was “sorry we can’t help you if you chose to go it’s at your own experiences” to which I asked if I were to go home and get some sleep and come back an hour before the flight is estimated would I be allowed onto my very delayed flight to which the response I received from the staff was “we don’t know we can’t help you with that” for a £250 flight and a total of 18hours of delay we received a £3 voucher which was not even enough for a coffee and a bottle of water. I was so distressed and upset I decided to cancel my flight and retrieve my bags, just as I thought it couldn’t get worse when I received my luggage back it came ruined and damaged! Once again I asked a staff member for help and I was told “I don’t know take pictures or something I can’t help you”.

52,R Christie," This review relates to my second flight with Ryanair following a trip to Fuerteventura. The check-in staff at Fuerteventura airport were very professional and friendly too. Boarding was something of a mishap as there was no reinforcement of the priority boarding. This caused an upheaval as several passengers, rightly voiced their grievances over this. This was a very full flight including several family groups. The cabin crew were far more professional than on my outbound flight and imposed a strict no nuts regime as a passenger had a nut allergy. One crew member stood out from her peers, who was not only very professional but seemed to go the extra mile to assist an elderly couple and to help a lady who was unwell. This crew member is a great credit to Ryanair and deserves recognition for her professionalism and common sense. During the flight 2 to-buys drinks and snacks rounds were performed and again the crew did very well indeed. Although there was a delay of circa 50 minutes to departure this was communicated very well to the passengers. Disembarkation was quite something as a problem passengers stood up before landing and ignored instructions to sit down. This passenger rudely pushed his away along the aisle and brushed a cabin crew member aside. Astonishingly poor behaviour. The cabin crew should not have to deal with such appalling behaviour.

53,R Christie,"  Stansted to Fuerteventura. Firstly, the airline deserves credit for an easy to use website. Follow the rules and one should be just fine within the remit of budget travel! I checked-in online without any issues and when I arrived at the airport, the priority boarding was largely enforced. The flight had a slight delay but communication was reasonable. Another let down was the poor attitude of two staff members. One lady seemed to do all the work while her colleagues took a back-seat attitude. I had a negative experience when I needed to use the lavatory. I politely asked a male member of the cabin crew if the lavatory was free? I am visually impaired. To my shock the staff member in question sighed and mumbled something in another language without answering my question. Disembarkation was a farce as the abusive woman and her brood pushed to the exit without any of the cabin crew correcting the dangerous behaviour eg standing up and removing bags from the locker before the flight had even properly landed. This was quite distressing for many passengers and a clear danger. Moreover the seats were very hard and uncomfortable and the charge for a soft drink was an outrage!",Economy Class,n,2022-11-05,stansted fuerteventura firstly airline deserves credit easy use website follow rule one fine within remit budget travel checked online without issue arrived airport priority boarding largely enforced flight slight delay communication reasonable another let poor attitude two staff member one lady seemed work colleague took back seat attitude negative experience needed use lavatory politely asked male member cabin crew lavatory free visually impaired shock staff member question sighed mumbled something another language without answering question disembarkation farce abusive woman brood pushed exit without cabin crew correcting dangerous behaviour eg standing removing bag locker flight even properly landed quite distressing many passenger clear danger moreover seat hard uncomfortable charge soft drink outrage,-0.9678,Negative,817

65,Povilas Sindriūnas,  I recently had an unpleasant experience with Ryanair going from Barcelona to Budapest. The flight was delayed by around 3 hours due to reasons I wasn't told. This has caused spending an extra overnight stay at Budapest with hotel and transport expenses from my own pocket and booking a new flight the next day. Because the flight was delayed by so much I have lost my connecting flight for which I had a 2 hour layover window. No desks were operating when I got to Budapest at around 23:00. Received no apology or guidance at the time of the need. Disappointing experience being a frequent Ryanair flyer. Caused me a lot of problems. I have filled the Ryanair form and also sent an additional query.

68,Eleonora Schianchi,"  I seriously thought we would never get home safely ... but that was not the only terrible part! After a nice week of vacation we take a Ryanair flight from Porto to Milan, estimated duration: about 2 hours (?). We are almost to our destination but we are told that we cannot land because of a thunderstorm. Result: we stay for more than an hour and a half suspended in the sky amid black clouds, lightning and thunders at close range. After that we are told that it will not be possible to land in Milan, so they take us to another airport (without telling us which one, except once we land!). We finally land in Genoa, tired but glad to be on land. Another hour and a half of waiting and we are told that we will be departing again? In the meantime, no one offers us water, food, but the captain tells us that we have ""permission to contact family and relatives,"" if we desire. In the meanwhile, we contact our hotel to alert them to the uncertainty of the situation; they unfortunately warn us that it will not be possible to check in in the middle of the night (it was midnight by then). We arrive at Milan Linate and manage to catch the last shuttle to downtown Milan, where we squeeze into the first hotel next to the Central Station, in order to make as little distance as possible at midnight with baggage and personal belongings. Bewildered but exhausted and thus resigned, we pay three times the price of the hotel originally booked, which did not allow us to have a refund because of the short notice. Finally, once back home we decide to pursue a refund request (end of July 2022), promptly rejected because EU261 regulations do not provide for refunds due to ""unforeseeable"" conditions. We call support again, who suggests we ask for compensation instead of a refund (August 2022). In September 2022 I submit the request, in October 2022 I receive no response (waiting time described by the site for processing the request: 10 days), and decide to call the client support again. The operators, as always rude and annoyed, say they will send a reminder. I have no words for the incompetence of this company, their treatment of passengers (leaving them without water, food, explanations) is absolutely inhumane.",Economy Class,n,2022-10-03,seriously thought would never get home safely terrible part nice week vacation take ryanair flight porto milan estimated duration hour almost destination told land thunderstorm result stay hour half suspended sky amid black cloud lightning thunder close range told possible land milan take u another airport without telling u one except land finally land genoa tired glad land another hour half waiting told departing meantime one offer u water food captain tell u permission contact family relative desire meanwhile contact hotel alert uncertainty situation unfortunately warn u possible check middle night midnight arrive milan linate manage catch last shuttle downtown milan squeeze first hotel next central station order make little distance possible midnight baggage personal belonging bewildered exhausted thus resigned pay three time price hotel originally booked allow u refund short notice finally back home decide pursue refund request end july promptly rejected eu regulation provide refund due unforeseeable condition call support suggests ask compensation instead refund august september submit request october receive response waiting time described site processing request day decide call client support operator always rude annoyed say send reminder word incompetence company treatment passenger leaving without water food explanation absolutely inhumane,-0.9496,Negative,1370
69,L Johnson,"  It all started what now seems a lifetime ago when sitting enjoying the sites of Lisbon City centre when my partner checked the Ryanair app out of mere curiosity to find our flight was delayed by over 3 hours. Inconvenient yes, but perhaps we could enjoy a few extra hours before heading to the airport? A quick chat with customer services should easily tell us if that's OK or whether we must be there for the original departure time.  After 20 minutes of fighting the customer service chat feature we gave up. A completely automated response to all questions, none of which related to the query at hand. Fast forward to the airport - the main terminal looks nice but we get shuttled off to the budget terminal.  Past security, not fun but not the fault of Ryanair at least. The delay is over 4 hours now so a quick search online shows we are entitled to food and drink. Best find a member of their helpful crew who will be happy to help! A walk of all the gates though provides slim pickings .. perhaps they don't want to help the people from the growing list of flights being delayed? When we did track down a member of staff at a gate, we were  ushered through a gate to a Ryanair desk that could help, only to find on going through the door that it was a one way trip - back to the initial check-in slaughterhouse. I feel by this point we all know what the response was at the check-in desk - go and ask at the gate of course. We tried to argue briefly. We took the tickets, we accept our fate. At least the comforting knowledge we received from the checkin desk that someone will come out and offer help from Ryanair back at the gate will keep us warm over the upcoming hours of woe. Back at the gate now. Security was even better the second time around, apparently they don't like boarding passes being used twice. When we mentioned Ryanair though they seemed to get it. Not sure how many hours to go. Perhaps a member of Ryanair will come and offer assistance at some point. Perhaps even food. Or water.

72,K Thaine,"  Ryanair is unfailingly the most horrific airline to fly with. Appalling customer service, attracts clients because of its seemingly “cheap” tickets but there is always hidden fees somewhere. This time it was because i arrived to check in 1 hour and 45 minutes before flight instead of two hours - so got charged 30 euros. I had tried to check in for both flights at my departure destination as I knew I wouldn’t have a lot of time at the transit stop to do the check in. Bad tempered Ryan Air staff told me I couldn’t but she just seemed like she couldn’t be bothered. I then got charged 30 euros at the transit stop because I had checked in ‘late’ (even though I had tried to do it 4 hours earlier). The thing that bothers me the most though is that they advertise “free airport check in two hours before flight departure” but fail to mention that they will charge you if its less than that time, or how much they will charge you (they probably do tell you somewhere in small print but the spirit is one of being scammed).

93,Christopher Rainbow,"  This review relates to a Ryanair Flight from London Stansted to Rimini in Italy on 26th July 2022. Firstly, the website is logical and well set out stating the rules and policies of the airline. Follow the rules and there are no problems. I should like to commend the Check-in staff for their help and efficiency. I took a train from London to the Stansted airport unfortunately the luggage of another passenger ripped the top of my bag. The check-in staff noticed this rip and were very helpful towards me. Boarding the flight was another matter as there was a rather large group of Italian teenagers returning home to Italy. Their chaperones were badly organised and the Ryanair ground staff did not manage this well resulting in a delay to the flight of about forty minutes. None of the ground staff showed any initiative in this situation. None of the ground staff spoke any Italian and there was no effort to translate to the teenagers.  Passengers were allowed to queue in the bridge before the flight was ready to depart. There were steep stairs to be negotiated and I assisted an elderly passenger with the stairs as no warning had been given about the stairs. The security demonstration was reasonably well conducted. Service was lacklustre with one cabin crew yawning over her passengers and rolling her eyes and looked bored. The lovely lady who sat next to me ordered a prosecco and was gruffly handed her drink and a cracked plastic glass. The drink spilled over the lady and the male cabin crew showed no interest and seemed to expect the passenger to continue drinking from the cracked plastic glass. The male staff member had to be asked to find some paper towels and to replace the glass. He sighed indignantly when asked to do so. At one stage a member of the cabin crew locked the lavatory and caused a line to form. There was no apology or explanation either. The landing was fine but disembarkation was chaotic and poorly managed. Based on this experience, I would think twice about booking with this airline again. The ground staff were superb, friendly and polite and very helpful. Their professionalism was let down by the cabin crew.",Economy Class,n,2022-07-30,review relates ryanair flight london stansted rimini italy th july firstly website logical well set stating rule policy airline follow rule problem like commend check staff help efficiency took train london stansted airport unfortunately luggage another passenger ripped top bag check staff noticed rip helpful towards boarding flight another matter rather large group italian teenager returning home italy chaperone badly organised ryanair ground staff manage well resulting delay flight forty minute none ground staff showed initiative situation none ground staff spoke italian effort translate teenager passenger allowed queue bridge flight ready depart steep stair negotiated assisted elderly passenger stair warning given stair security demonstration reasonably well conducted service lacklustre one cabin crew yawning passenger rolling eye looked bored lovely lady sat next ordered prosecco gruffly handed drink cracked plastic glass drink spilled lady male cabin crew showed interest seemed expect passenger continue drinking cracked plastic glass male staff member asked find paper towel replace glass sighed indignantly asked one stage member cabin crew locked lavatory caused line form apology explanation either landing fine disembarkation chaotic poorly managed based experience would think twice booking airline ground staff superb friendly polite helpful professionalism let cabin crew,0.9766,Positive,1399

95,Matt Sage,"  Arrived at the airport after a busy couple of days. Didn’t have time to check-in online as we tried doing it but you had to go through multiple different steps that if you’re not tech savvy don’t make a lot of sense. We were shocked to find out that to get our boarding passes you had to pay 55euros each to receive a hand written paper boarding pass with your name and info. We booked together and were not seated next to each other. Then when we asked if we could sit next to each other they tried to charge us an additional fee. To top it all off, after running around to different desks and getting handwritten boarding passes, we then found out that one of us allegedly hadn’t paid for a 20kg cabin bag, when both of our receipts showed that we had.

I was sitting in row 9 and by the time service came to me they had no soft drinks left and had also run put of water! They had no milk on the outbound flight for hot drinks. Paid a lot of money for these flights and was late both ways. The plane coming back was so hot and uncomfortable and nothing to rehydrate for many passengers either as I got the last bottle of water 20 passengers into service. No paper in the toilet and a surly and jaded looking set of flight attendants. Landed at 2.05 am and had a long wait for baggage also. Didn't actually get out of the airport til after 3am. We had to book priority boarding if we wanted to bring 10kg carry on bags and guess what, everyone was released and boarded all at the same time in a herd like way.

The boarding process was a complete chaos, there was no call for speedy boarding customers and eventually we were made to wait in front of the plane in one large queue, holding the baby in my arms in the cold, and I was literally the last person to enter the plane. I complained to the staff on board and they were very apologetic and advised me to request a refund online. I have filed for a refund for the speedy boarding service, waited 4 months for a reply and when it came, it simply read as for our conditions we do not offer refunds.

I asked where our luggage was and they had no idea and they were completely lost.

I asked them to give me what they offer in writing as proof from my employer as long as to request a reimbursement from the insurance company. I had bought insurance coverage through Ryanair's application. They refused to give me what I asked and they gave me a paper with the links to request a refund in case I didn't want to fly in 5 days and to open a request to Ryanair's help center to provide me the evidence of the cancellation and the alternative options they offered me. I also asked why they didn't give us the paper while we were waiting for so many hours in the queue to read our rights and decide without waiting for so long, and they replied ""we don't know"".

It's almost as if they don't tell you the information so that you pay more when you reach the gate. I booked an around trip and on my departure to Corfu and my bags went through the system smoothly and without any concern, but then on my flight back home, with the same exact priority that I had on my first departure they tell me that my bag is too big and I have to pay extra for it. The girl at the check-in did not say anything about me having to pay even extra at the gate, and I was not the only one that went through this process. Not only did I have to pay extra, the Ryanair personnel at the gate were very rude and gave me and others attitude. And to top it off, the flight was just as expected by me, late. We had to stand outside for 40 minutes while the large jets were testing their engines. I could go on but I won't. All in all a very disappointing experience.

One of them, looked at my passport, saw Ukrainian nationality in it and asked for a Covid test. I was fully vaccinated and at this time the requirements on Ryanair website was either full vaccination or a test. I showed all my proofs of vaccination and a self-test, but she kept demanding that I do a test at the airport worth GBP 40. I pointed out the requirements on the website were different and then she said “one more comment and you are not flying”. I took the test, spent money and 90 minutes waiting for the results, and returned to the check-in. By then there was another agent at the counter, she said I didn’t need the test and proof of full vaccination would do. I returned to speak to the first staff member, but she yelled at me in front of other customers calling me rude and saying that she refuses to “serve me” in any circumstances.

124,S James," Firstly, as a member of staff at the airport I must say, I hear alot of bad things about Ryanair but let me tell you as someone who meets many passengers and works close to the action, my knowledge about Ryanair at Manchester Airport is huge. There isn't much room for a person who is overweight in 1 of Ryanair seats, they'll probably be uncomfortable for the whole flight, especially next to the window. Ryanair use Terminal 3. It's a no smoking terminal. Ryanair quote, ""low fares"", but they mean the starting price is a low fare. It soon adds up to cost just as much as easyjet or jet2. When you board or come off a Ryanair flight you'll find it's always up/down the steps not through the airbridge. When you're waiting for your suitcase. Expect to be waiting for at least 1 hour and 30 mins. Otherwise you might loose your mind and take it out on the wrong member of staff....like me. On our way home from Rome we arrived at the airport, got through security. I decided to check my phone to see where the plane was using Plane Finder. The answer to my question....Manchester. It had literally just taken off. We left nearly an hour late. During the flight we were told no food or drink available. Imagine if we purchased an inflight meal. We arrived at Manchester but spent 3 hours waiting for our bags because Swissport must've only had 3 people unloading each Ryanair flight. So we were 1 of 3 flights landed. For 3 planes there is a maximum of 3 baggage handlers. I know this because the baggage handler told me. I decided to ask him what abuse he was getting from a passenger who landed with me that day.

127,P Kemp," Apart from horrendous queues at Birmingham (not Ryanair's fault), flights both ways (operated by Malta Air, a subsidiary of Ryanair) were excellent. Ground staff and flight attendants were friendly and helpful. The planes were clean and our seats (we paid a bit extra for exit seats) were roomy. We do not normally buy food on board, but as the return was a lunchtime flight, we bought a sandwich and drink, which were, respectively, hot and cold and were very reasonably priced. Flights both ways were more or less on time.

128,P Walter," When you consider all the extra fees this airline is not value for money at all. From now I will avoid this airline at all costs and recommend everyone to do the same. Their customer service is the opposite of what customer service should be. If you do not wish to pay an extra fee for check-in, you need to do it online 24 hours before the flight. However if you try to do it 2 hours before the flight, it is already closed and you need to check in at the airport and pay an extra fee of 55 Euros per person at the counter. Forcing customers to pay extra fees that are higher than the actual ticket! For a service that takes their employee 2 minutes. That's down right scammy in my opinion. We didn't even get seats next to each other even though we paid that fee. I had the same on another flight when checking in online, unless you pay extra online, you will be systematically assigned random seats not next to each other.

She made a b-line towards my mum and I and out of the blue said our bags had to go in the hold. For a second I couldn't believe it. These are the same bags and same size and weight we used going up from Malta. So much so that I am thorough with travelling light and my mother's bag in particular is a Ryanair approved sized wheelie bag. To prove a point the lady at the check in placed it in the sizer which fit perfectly only to tell us that it's above the line! I thought to myself this is a joke. In the meantime a quarter of the other passengers in the non prio line had bulky rucksacks twice the size of our bags which would have never fit in the sizer. I paid the 90 odd euros for this thieving act and vow to never use Ryanair again. This airline bends and manipulates the rules to suit them and they change from airport to airport and staff to staff.

Hence, it should be safe to assume that the counter check in is available and working. We arrived nearly 2 hours before departure and spent 1,5 hour in a queue waiting to be checked in together with lots of other people. 2 counters only were open, which obviously was insufficient. We asked a Ryanair representative if it was possible to speed up the process, but she was only interested in lecturing us and questioning why we had not used the net check in, rather than doing something to speed things up so people didn´t lose their flight. She might well be right that this is a better option but in our situation that is totally beyond the point. No actions taken, nothing done, just a shrug. We managed just about to arrive gate on last and final call just to be stuck in an unventilated corridor with all the other passengers for 25 minutes before boarding started.

All Ryanair staff we dealt with were polite and helpful, couldn’t fault them at all so will certainly use them again. Only reason I don’t award full marks was because on the outward flight cabin crew made toilets at the front of the plane for crew only so everyone had to use the back and with the catering trolleys in the aisle for most of the flight it made for some very uncomfortable passengers, no such problem on the return flight.",Economy Class,y,2022-05-14,many many flight studiously avoiding ryanair decided give go usually travel luton fly faro luton airport nightmare decided go ryanair local airport birmingham must admit pleasantly surprised check birmingham faro took minute flight time fact return journey arrived minute early ryanair staff dealt polite helpful fault certainly use reason award full mark outward flight cabin crew made toilet front plane crew everyone use back catering trolley aisle flight made uncomfortable passenger problem return flight,0.6249,Positive,509
137,A Osobu," Leeds to Majorca. My experience was absolutely horrendous. We paid for fast track from Leeds - Majorca - Valencia - Majorca - Leeds. This was a waste of money as we stood in line which was slower than the normal queue at Leeds Airport. On our way back from Majorca we were seated in the waiting area and approached by one of the staff who demanded to see our boarding pass. We showed her the boarding pass and she immediately demanded that we follow her to the desk. She told my nephew that he had a non-priority ticket and said ""I need your credit card."" When he asked why, she said he had another case and needed to pay £45 now or else he could not fly. She and her colleague seemed to feel proud of the way she had put us on display embarrassing us in front of everyone else who had now lined up behind us. We were being stared at angrily as it seemed we were holding up the queue. I thought I had paid for priority tickets as I paid for fast track and selected seats. I showed them the icon on my Ryanair account after logging in and the responded saying they didn't know what that was. They had to call someone on the phone as my nephew who is American provided an Amex card. They kept us at the desk in front of everyone who thought we were holding up the queue for more than 10 minutes. I asked and they wouldn't give me any more information. Eventually, my nephew got his passport and his boarding pass back and they started embarking. They asked us to wait even though I had paid for fast track and we were already at the front of the queue. They deliberately kept us there and let us board after I became upset. When we boarded we were confronted by the flight attendant who told us that the cabin bag we had just paid for needed to be in the cargo bay even though it's smaller than normal cabin cases. I advised them we had paid and pointed at the tag which was snow taped to the bag and she insisted that we should have been told to put in cargo. I tried to explain that they didn't tell us and we wouldn't know that as we don't work for the airline. She put her hands up in my face cutting me off and stating that its the airport and not the airline and she doesn't work for the airport. I advised that we don't work for the airport either. She agreed for us to have our case in the overhead compartment but stated that should it fill up, it would need to go in the cargo area. We watched as cases bigger and heavier than my nephews were placed in the overhead compartment with no argument. I have never been so embarrassed as I have with Ryanair and will never fly using Ryanair ever again. I will tell anyone who will listen to what happened and never fly Ryanair again.

147,P Vidan,"  The last time I am ever going to fly with them. When arriving at the airport for check in, there was only one member of staff on the relevant desks and so a lengthy wait was needed before we got to speak to them. By the time we did speak with them, she informed us that we had just missed the check in period and each ticket was now to be charged £55 in order to check in. The total of £110 was as expensive as the actual flight tickets, if not more. The late check in was primarily due to the understaffing at the Ryanair counter at Stansted and not to any poor time keeping or organisation on our part. After reluctantly paying this extortionate fee (what other choice did we have?), we then proceeded through security and on to our gate. Once we boarded the plane however, there was than a 1 hr 45 min delay to our flight where we sat on the tarmac and waited. Having been charged £110 just moments earlier for being late and then being delayed for almost 2 hours really angered me. The late check in fee was entirely unnecessary and immensely overpriced in the first place, but what with our flight being delayed, it then also proved to be completely redundant.

151,B Richardson," This was the first time I have flown with Ryanair for years, after previous bad experiences, and I only flew as it was part of a package deal. It’s not that much cheaper than other airlines, which would give a better experience. The boarding process was the worst I have ever experienced. We were second in the priority queue and ended up, passing through the gate and waiting at the bottom steps waiting for a bus for ages, then we were one of the first to board the bus. We then had to wait on the bus at the bottom of the aircraft for ages, and when we got off the bus, surprise surprise we were now much further from the front. This is Ryanair priority boarding.

152,S Tuckett,"  Worst customer service experience I have ever had. We arrived an hour and a half before departure and went to check in. Ryanair only had two employees. One member of my company and I were denied our COVID certification due to a difference in Italian rules we were unaware of, which was fair, except we were leaving the country to go to the UK where we were in line with the rules. Regardless the staff sent us to the basement to buy a COVID rapid test. Within 20 minutes we were upstairs again with our results, but the two employees had closed the check in counter, after they had told us to run downstairs to get a test and then come back for our boarding passes. We couldn’t get our passes online because it directed us to the ticket counter, but the ticket counter had stranded us. The rest of our party had headed through security while we got our tests and approached the Ryanair staff on that side and told them our dilemma. They told us to obtain our boarding passes online, which we couldn’t do because it directed us to the ticket counter. They told us we had to book new flights because no one was at the check in counter. We were early enough we would have made the flight had someone been at the check in counter to simply print our passes (as we had checked in online). Our party members talking with the employees at the gate talked with them for 50 minutes trying to get them to send someone to log in but they refused. During that conversation we informed the Ryanair representatives that one of the stranded members was prone to seizures and was out of their medication (which was in England. They simply hadn’t brought extra) and needed to be on the flight to get her medication. The staff was unresponsive, with the manager also refusing to get our passes and when told about the seizure situation was told that if they seized “we would have to take them to a hospital”. After no help those of us that were stranded found a hotel and arrived there before the flight took of, as it departed 50 minutes after the scheduled departure time. Absolutely the worst experience.

156,Paul Groves,"  
Beware of the latest scam - 3rd party services booked on the Ryanair website: I was flying from London to Malaga and, when I purchased extra hold luggage the day before I flew, I decided to, at the same time, also buy a ticket for National Express from Victoria coach station to Stansted airport. I did so and paid one amount on my credit card, but I received no confirmation of the National Express booking, so I called NE and they had no record of my booking or payment. I did so again the next morning - still no record, so I had to buy the ticket again at a higher price. I tried to call Ryanair, but could not get through to them, nor had any success with their ""live"" chat. After arriving in Malaga I tried to get a refund from Ryanair, whom I had paid, but they said that I needed to get this from NE and that it had nothing to do with them as NE were a third party service provider. All my explanations that I had paid Ryanair and NOT NE were ignored. So I called NE again and they still said that they had no record of the reservation or payment, so I had to make a claim against my credit card company for a refund. All this took several hours of my time and was incredibly stressful. It was a relatively small amount, but I was incensed by Ryanair's approach and determined to get my money back. They are truly shocking in their customer service.  Only fly with them if there is NO alternative, even if other airlines are more expensive. Only buy the most basic/cheapest ticket and only upgrade or buy extras (seat choice, hold luggage, food, etc) as late as possible and just before your flight - in case there is a change of plan or cancellation, then your refund amount is much lower. Never purchase 3rd party services from their website - car rental, coach travel, hotels, etc. If there is a problem then they will screw you.

We tried to cancel our Ryanair tickets for flight FR 1558 and request for a refund for 321.96 € on Dec 16 but to no avail. We are very disappointed and what’s worse is I was told by Ryanair that its refund policy does not cater for flights that are not cancelled by the airline but I could pay 180 € to change my tickets before the flight took off on Dec 17.

167,Romain Esteban," There is no word in the English language that can fully describe how bad this airline is. I’ve had my shares of bad experience with Ryanair but always thought “Well, my bad I should have been more prepared I guess” or “they are probably having a bad day, cut them some slack” etc. But if you’re going to be aggressive and verbally abusive to two senior travelers, then we’re going to have a real problem. Even more if the seniors in question are my parents who have a limited knowledge of English. My parents came to visit us this weekend. They arrived in London fully prepared, vaccinated, passports, forms, VeriFly app literally everything that was required and asked of them. They flew in with BA at Heathrow and everything went smoothly (take some notes Stansted!). Then we prepared their return journey and they made sure to book 2 handbags (that’s how it works now you have to pay for handbags too). So, prior to the trip they booked two ‘less than 10 kg handbags’ on the agency’s website which gave them also the right to priority board (something they were not aware of). They actually waited and queued until it was time to board and once in front of the person at the desk were asked to pay £90 for the two bags. My dad tried to explain he already paid for it, but she didn’t want to hear it, she laughed to their faces because they tried to explain themselves with the few English words they know, and then she realized that my dad speaks Spanish (apparently, she did too) so they managed to understand each other to some extent. She lost patience and told my parents it was either they paid for the bags, or they had to leave them behind. Scared and tired by the situation they decided to pay and after they got the confirmation and the sticky tag on their bags asked if they could get an invoice or receipt. The lady said she didn’t have it and that they will receive it by email. However never confirmed it with my dad and asked them to quickly move towards the plane and embark. Then someone - I'm guessing who's a security person - yelled at them in the corridor in English (remember a language they don't understand) and kept screaming and shouting at them for a good minute without thinking they might not be able to understand his language. Literally no patience, no kindness, no respect. My parents managed to connect the dots and gathered that he wanted them to leave the bags outside the plane (remember small handbags less than 10 kg) they pointed a corner to him, and he let out some kind of agreeing grunt. Then once on board they probably were thinking they could finally relax, but no, once again someone with a lot of empathy and sympathy decided otherwise. The hostess that day kept asking my mum to remove her jacket, and put it up in the overhead bin, then underneath the seat, then finally take it back and put it on her knees because it wasn’t right, and every 5 minutes came back to check if she was ""cooperating"" because she also asked my mum to remove her scarf and for some reason it needed to be left with the jacket. What is wrong in your head? When a lady of a certain age is cold, you pressure her into removing her clothes? First, I don’t get what the security hazard is with a scarf. Second, it’s literally freezing outside, and we know how cold it can be inside the plane before take-off, also ever heard of covid. I mean come on.

179,Phuong K Thai," Our flight from Crete to Athens started off with online check-in issues. We followed the prompts, but there was no option for check in, only to cancel or change flight. We even watched a video but never was presented with a check in option on the mobile website. When we arrived at the airport, we spoke to one of the employees at the bag check line, and explained to her our issue with online check in. She offered no help or advice, only said there is nothing for her to do and that we must pay €55 each to print our tickets or we could speak to her coworker at a Skyserv help desk. We proceeded to the alternate employee at the Skyserv booth and once again explained our troubles with online check in. We even showed her the step by step process in which we tried to check in on our mobile phone. She started to raise her voice and said “I don’t know why you’re the only people having an issue. Other customers don’t have this issue. It’s clearly something you did wrong!” Instead of providing us with actual help and presenting a fix to the issue that we physically showed her on the phone, she was dismissive, blaming us, and outright rude. When we wished to escalate the matter, she refused to tell us her name and began acting even more erratic. She stated that “Ryanair will know who I am and I don’t have to give you any information.” At this point we were forced into making one of two decisions - miss our flight or pay €55 for each boarding pass. Extremely unsatisfied with the lack of help, we returned to the bag check desk, and decided to go ahead with the payment. At our second interaction with the bag check staff, we were informed that the price per boarding pass is now €62.50! We showed them the Ryanair email that said it was €55 and explained to said staff that she told us ten minutes prior that it was a €55 fee. The employee told us to look at her screen if we have an issue, because that’s what it says and she could give no explanation for the discrepancy in Ryanair email or what we were previously told. At this point we were uncomfortably coerced into choosing to either miss our flight or pay this new arbitrary price that no employee could give an explanation for. No one can explain to us why we were unable to check in online and no one can explain to us why there was an increase in price after this entire debacle. Fast forward two months after this incident and multiple complaints to Ryanair, they finally responded with again no resolution. A representative from Ryanair emailed stating, ""At first, I would like to express our sympathy regarding the circumstances resulting in you being unable to have done the check-in online. However, if a customer does not manage to check-in online then an airport check-in fee of €55/£55 per person is applied."" This acknowledges our inability to check-in, but somehow still place the blame on the customer.

Arrived at the gate in good time at stansted and the crew at the gate told me off for arriving when they had only just called final boarding. Told my husband they were lucky they were letting him on the flight. The flight was ok out, until one of the crew shouted at the man next to me whose small washbag had broken and was trying not to drop things out of it as he was putting it in the overhead locker. Arrived with all documentation, getting my PLF form sorted to show the gate on my phone and was asked if I’d had a Covid test (this was Italy now trying to return) all paperwork complete and was told not to bother showing my PLF as needed a Covid test and wasn’t allowed to board. We are fully vaccinated and have our day 2 tests ordered. Still refused boarding, despite saying we didn’t need them but he wouldn’t/couldn’t speak English. Took a taxi (€60) to get a test (€30) & bought tickets @ €270. We don’t need a Covid test, should have been allowed on our flight and as Ciampino airport closes overnight we are being made to sleep in the street.

Arriving at the ticket counter 5 hours before the flight's scheduled departure, I approached the ticketing counter, explained my dilemma to a ticket agent, and with her able and timely assistance was able to implement a work-around on my mobile device which enabled me to eventually obtain my boarding pass. The agent was courteous and patient as she worked to sort out my problem. Ryanair's business model is predicated in hyper efficiency, so traditional ""customer service"" per se often suffers, and often results in decidedly mixed reviews from travelers.

203,A Deane,"  I had always promised myself I’d never fly Ryanair but this time they were my only option. First up, booking and checking in etc. I found it pretty simple, I heard horror stories about people being charged ridiculous sums at checkin for boarding passes etc but so long as you read the instructions on the website you can’t really go wrong. And that’s the only positive thing I’m going to say about Ryanair. The aircraft was a new looking 737-800. On my flight out to bud from stn I was lucky enough to have an entire row of seats to myself, despite the rest of the aircraft being near capacity. Any airline I’ve flown with, in hot weather, will have the cabin a/c active for boarding. Not Ryanair. We sat in 30 degree heat for about 30 minutes with not so much as a breeze.  That didn’t really matter though, because the overhead fans were just awful. On this aircraft were recessed into the facia, so the direction couldn’t be altered. Add to that the “breeze” wouldn’t have been sufficient to blow out an already fading candle on a child’s birthday cake. I had two fans pointing vaguely in my direction, both set to full, both failing to live up to their job descriptions. The seats were they bad, narrow and with about 2mm of padding.  Now for the speedy boarding scam, I was standing in the terminal in BUD with the rest of the non speedy folk while the last of the speedy boarders had cleared the gate a good ten minutes previously. I was a little miffed up until I saw the speedy boarders all standing in a “cage” section of the air bridge (pictured) completely in air conditioned and completely open to the more than 30 degree heat.

The fact that the place three family members in three different places in the plane (an eleven year old girl alone) during times where we should keep distance to other people. I know as a fact that they did this to other families as well, as I asked the guy next to me to swop seats with my daughter. He got very happy as my daughter was sitting next to his brother. I know this is part of their policy that you have to pay for choosing seats next to each other but during COVID-19 this is simply not good enough.

212,Julie Govoni,"  I had positive experiences in the past with ryanair, better than other low cost. This time though I felt it's important to share. I do not recommend to buy tickets with them now in time of COVID. Ryanair promises to change your flights free of charge or extend voucher, but one week before flight. I supposed to fly to Bologna from Prague, pre condition is to have a PCR test not older than 3 days. My husband got positive and obviously we had to go to quarantine. I reached out ryanair and only option available was actually to change flights, but for every option they were charging full price extra for luggage (it's 40 euro on top of 50 I have already paid for luggage) and therefore any option I was extra I have to pay to keep tickets was way higher than to buy completely new. So I've asked if there is a way to cancel and get at least something back even through voucher to use it for other flight, but 150 euro of one ticket thrown away. But in this particular case it's cheating on clients: we are doing here tests on weekly base and you cannot predict to get Covid before flight if you were fine week before and extra nearly full charge for luggage on top is really stealing money. Now my feelings are that if I have to fly, next time I will buy tickets with someone else.",Economy Class,n,2021-07-03,positive experience past ryanair better low cost time though felt important share recommend buy ticket time covid ryanair promise change flight free charge extend voucher one week flight supposed fly bologna prague pre condition pcr test older day husband got positive obviously go quarantine reached ryanair option available actually change flight every option charging full price extra luggage euro top already paid luggage therefore option extra pay keep ticket way higher buy completely new asked way cancel get least something back even voucher use flight euro one ticket thrown away particular case cheating client test weekly base predict get covid flight fine week extra nearly full charge luggage top really stealing money feeling fly next time buy ticket someone else,0.9368,Positive,777

I waited for almost 6 months to be able to go home and be with my mom. I have tried to fly out using another airline, two days prior to the current flight I took with Ryanair, and to my shock I was denied to fly because I didn’t have the identity card to be in the country I was flying in.  I had the test results, which were negative, the declaration form. Which I thought I was ready to go. Only because I was not a resident in Italy, I was denied. I emailed the Italian embassy as I was going back home, confused and desperate. They emailed right back and said that I don’t need a permission to enter the country. I found as well the updated info regarding flying to Italy, anyone could fly not only residents from April 7th. I then bought a new airline ticket from Ryanair. More affordable and to my surprise such a COVID 19 friendly use. For example, it has an easy access to all the forms necessary to fill in. And when you check in you upload all the forms and you are all set. All I did at the airport is to check in my big bag and go straight to the gate. I had to ask the person who checked me in if she’s going to check my documents and forms. She said no, because they have them all online as I submitted them. And the COVID test that I took on April 6 was still valid on 11th April and I didn’t have to take another one. I still did, and spend £300 in total.

226,M Morales," I use to fly between Germany and Spain about 20 roundtrips a year, usually on Ryanair. I consider Ryanair's product to be well suited for my needs. Just a seat, no frills, low price, easy way to get from A to B. Nevertheless within the last weeks Ryanair has started to arbitrarily cancel flights due to a low load factor. Somehow I understand this, when there is a sudden change in government rules and people just stop buying tickets. But now Ryanair just cancels whatever flight, that was offered a few weeks ago, just because their load factor is too low for their needs. This happened about two weeks ago and I had to rearrange my travelling, throwing away a couple of tickets from the 8 flights I had already booked with Ryanair. Now they do the same thing once again and my travel plans are totally screwed. From the few flights Ryanair offers, they just cancel whatever flight they want to, obviously without compensation. Therefore I strongly advice to NOT book any Ryanair flight, unless there is normal travelling available maybe in spring 2022.

233,Uttom Nandi," Ryanair gave a promotion of no fees to change a flight, so I booked my flight on the 10th September, to fly on 3rd October to 13th October.

I could not manage to get 2 weeks extra holiday, so I changed my mind and I tried to explain this to 4 customer service agents (from 11 am to 4.30 pm), they showed to me their standard rule is a 7-day change rule and did not let me change my ticket date with fees free promotion. They said - I can only change my ticket before 7 days prior to the flight. They are not a legitimate company, there are so many hidden fees. I paid for my tickets (3 people) 203 GBP with parking, but to change my ticket, they asked me to pay 350 GBP (appx.) including seat booking, extra baggage, everything I have to pay again even though I haven’t used anything.

I didnt ask again since I had already asked for a refund and the request was accepted.

In addition, I bought a travel insurance for my flights, and after covid 19 cancellations, Ryannair informed me that they will refund the flight cost excluding the travel insurance cost. Their response was that because I could use the travel insurance for compensation. But then, when I asked if I can get compensation, they told me that according to the terms and conditions, I cannot get compensation for the cancellation. So they kept the insurance amount, even though there is no way to use the travel insurance!

241,Ben Bader,  Blatantly deceiving their customers into thinking they are protected with new bookings with free amendments but it’s all lies. If you go to book the flight outright it is half the price of the flight when you are changing it to a new one. So they aren’t officially charging a change fee but it is absorbed in the new flight price.

242,G Dearman,"  This airline is an absolute disgrace, the treatment of customers is truly awful, we have had issues with 3 flights this year, I appreciate that corona virus has caused massive problems across many industries, non more so than the travel industry but the complete and utter disregard shown for its customers by Ryanair is nothing short of unbelievable. This year alone they have told a party of 7 that they could either change there flight date or receive a full refund due to a Covid related issue, we selected the refund but did not receive anything, when we contacted them again they said that they could not give a refund but could change the flights, which we then agreed to, again we heard nothing further and the flights did not change, once again we contacted them and they said that they could not change the flights and we would have to wait for a refund, after several more conversations we ended up changing the flights. These flights were booked to attend a family wedding and the revised flights had us returning early morning the day after the flight, we have logged onto the app tonight to check all the details to find that the return flight has been changed and they have not made any attempt to inform us. The return flight are now 30 minutes before the wedding was due to begin. When we were told for the second time that we would have to apply for a refund we were also told that no refunds would be paid out until the corona virus pandemic had ended. On a separate flight for the honeymoon of said wedding we have spent literally 3 full days waiting to talk to a member of the team on the live chat only to be left sat in the queue all day on each occasion. We regularly travel between Manchester and Naples to visit family and this is the only airline which flys regular direct routes between the 2 airports or I can assure you, we would never fly with this company again. I cannot express in words what a poor excuse for a company they are and my dealings with them have left me feeling that there should be much more stringent rules and regulations governing how airlines operate, I can’t think of any other business where you could change what you are selling to a customer and not be liable to pay them back in full immediately. If you have any other options for flights to any destination in the world then I would strongly recommend you take them as this company does not care for its customers in any way and will offer no help of something goes wrong with your travel plans.

244,Bence Solymosi,"  Ryanair has been the worst in dealing with the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. I booked a flight for 3 May, and still haven't received a refund on 21 August. I get that the pandemic is hugely disrupting but other airlines are doing so much better in quickly refunding canceled flights. I haven't even heard from them since the initial email about canceling my flight. There is an update on their website about how they are doing with their cancellation backlog but it's clearly bogus. It hasn't been updated since it's creation and the things it states are untrue. In the beginning, Ryanair has been pushing vouchers on their customers who asked for refunds, and made it as hard as possible to contact them (it's still next to impossible). I guess this is exactly the case of getting what you pay for. Sure Ryanair is cheap but you have to deal with things like this. The seats are tiny.

In total 4 flights I purchased. 1. the first flight was cancelled, I made a claim for a refund- they got back to me after a week with a voucher instead of money return and made it impossible and difficult to get my money back, eventually I had to give up and accept the voucher. The second flight I could not change for free, I could not make decision in less than 7 days prior to flying so I missed the ""free change option"" - did not fly. The other two flights were purchased together and because of that I just could not make change only to one of the flight, only to both of them. So I did not make a change, did not fly.

249,N Seketin,"  As of June 2020 you can simply add 55 EUR to the price of a one-way flight of you itinerary that is operated by Ryanair. If you don't check-in online, you have to pay for the check-in in the airport. It is there in the conditions, so no surprise. But if you google something like ""ryanair error check in"" there are quite many people complaining about not being able to check-in online. Though there are useless advice like trying other browser and clearing browser cookies. I had seats purchased, so theoretically I was able to check-in 60 days in advance. I tried it a week in advance, several days in advance, less that 2 days but more than 24 hours in advance. Never worked. You just fill all the check-in data in the account/booking, click next and nothing happens. In the browser console network tab you can see a 500 HTTP status return for the request made when you click ""next"". It usually means that the web service encountered an unexpected error, but of course only people that have access to the system can figure out why the error happened. User interface of Ryanair web application doesn't report any problem whatsoever, just does nothing. After not being able to check-in online, had to pay 55 EUR in the airport.

271,Paul Hayden,"  After reading horror stories of problems getting a refund from Ryanair, I would like to praise them for an efficient system. Was booked to travel April 5th, received cancellation email, and after going online to Ryanair website, the refund process took me approx 5 seconds and all went through.

I tried to reach them but it seems they intentionally blocked all ways to avoid refund. The phone lines are always busy and the website's chat bot only responds to standard FAQ questions.

278,S Dalleno,"  Bologna to Berlin. I have never been so disgusted by an airline like Ryanair. Due to corona virus in Italy things got a bit crazy, Bologna airport was overcrowded and security lines very slow. It took me 1h and 40 minutes to go through the security and I am sure it could have been even longer if I didn't put pressure to hurry up. Anyway, Ryanair didn't warn that lines were longer than usual and didn't make any announcement telling that the boarding was opening or that the boarding was closing. The gate was closed 18/20 minutes before flight departure (it is stated in their rule that this can happen, but I never experienced that). My question is can it be that in a very difficult moment such as the one in which Italy is, Ryanair decides to be even more strict and careless for his customer? I really have no words to describe how disappointed I was and how disgusted my such poor behaviour of this flight company. On top of this the employees at the desk were very rude and aggressive.

They forced me to leave my luggage aside at the boarding gate and couldn’t take it with me in the cabin. I couldn’t edit my reservation on the ryanair app and make it a ""priority"" one because they were asking for the email address and I booked through a website. Why couldn’t I just enter my last name with the reservation number? Worst treatment for its customers by far, worst ever.

286,S Maneros," I arrived to the airport in Rome, Ciampino and stood in line for the check in 1.5 hours before the boarding time. I was supposed to check in my luggage since I had also a small backpack and Ryanair policies do not allow the carry on of two pieces of luggage on board (the check in of this second bag was included in the ticket that I bought). While I was waiting in line (there were 50 people before me) the check in for Eindhoven suddenly closed without any announcements and I was not able to check in my extra luggage. The Ryanair lady at the counter told me that there was nothing that could be done, she told me to try and go directly to the gate and ask to make an exception so that I can bring my luggage onboard since it was a hand luggage and the check in closed without any warnings or announcements. When I arrived to the gate, another Ryanair lady told me that exceptions can not be made since internal policies obligate you to check in extra pieces of hand luggage. I tried to told her what happened but I had to pay a fee of EUR 25,00 and was not able to take the baggage on board. I was forced to hand it in before entering the plane and that was the last time I saw it being placed into the airplane hold without any damage, being perfectly intact. When I arrived to Eindhoven my luggage was returned through the luggage belt, and it was completely torn apart. I went to the damaged luggage counter to ask how to proceed since Ryanair was responsible for destroying my luggage! The lady at the counter told me that I had to fill in a complaint and then go to the Ryanair website and ask for a refund. I did everything as needed, including going to the police bureau at the airport in Eindhoven. Ryanair told me that they could not do anything about what happened except refunding me with EUR 20,00. The reason why they could not do anything about it was that, since I could not hand in the receipt of my luggage - bought some years ago - they could not make sure how much the luggage was worth, why and how on earth should one keep the receipt of a luggage that was bought years before? Ryanair does not care about its customers, neither did they in the past, nor will they in the future!

Instead, you have to book a separate adult far, all the ""pay per minute"" line to speak to someone, then pay an extra 30 euro ""link fee."" The only other option is to discard your original tickets and start from scratch. Don't let your carry ons be even a millimeter over the size limit or you'll be hit by a hefty fee.

In a 4 hour flight, where I would've normally slept through the entire flight, I couldn't sleep for more than 10 minutes straight because various carts - with food, perfumes and various other items for sell - were passing every 15 minutes, and because of constant announcements made by the crew. When I complained to my boyfriend, a fight attendant told me, very rudely 'ma'am this is the walking cabin, it's normal for the crew to be walking up and down with carts'. Maybe in Ryanair this is normal, but certainly not in other companies. When I arrived to Portugal, it took more than an hour - 1 hour and 12 minutes to be precise - for the bags from this flight to start to arrive. Two other fights that arrived much later already had their bags delivered on our mat, while we were still waiting. When asking Ryanair employees about what was going on with our bags, they said they couldn't help us or give us any information, as they didn't know.

304,G Worton,"  Dublin to Copenhagen. Was absolutely robbed by this airline. Had an issue checking in online the night before my flight, so my partner and I decided to get to the airport 3 hours early (we were recommended to get there 1hr early, but decided to take precautions!) just in case, as we’d been warned that Ryanair is very picky. At this stage, I should also mention that my partner and I are only travelling with Carry-On backpacks (no bags to check in - this has been fine on every other airline we’ve used during our 6 week holiday). We arrived at the desk only to be rudely told that checking in at the desk will cost us €55 each, and no, there was nothing they would do about that despite my issue with their website. And then the clerk eyed our backpacks and told us to go check those in as well. I’d already checked the pricing of baggage for the airline (some budget flights ask you to pay for carry-on, but I had found Ryanair only charges €10-20 for check in baggage and nothing for small carry-on). The cost for each bag to go under the plane? €40 each. That’s almost €200, just to get on the plane! That’s more expensive than my flight was to start with! Absolutely no customer care, let alone a shred of politeness or empathy. Nobody considered listening to our problem or even explaining why it had to be this way, and instead waved us away like we were being unreasonable for being shocked and upset by losing an unexpected €200.

We called them as a result of local gossip from the cab guy and it was only then we recurved support. We spent a further 2 hours trying to assitain what their plan B was. After much frustration they offer a flight two hours away from our current destination at the time when the flight was set to leave at 5 and had the cheek to tell us that if we don’t make it there’s nothing they can do. They didn’t even offer transfers having expressed to them that all surrounding fares have either doubled as locals were aware of the chaos and or public transport coaches and trains left at timing that would miss the flight. They even told us not to get into a cab that we informed them would charge us extortion rates. In the end we paid £400 for two cabs to take our group to the airport. As we rushed into the airport there were no Ryanair representatives for support, people waited around without refreshments or information for hours before anyone appeared to board us. When we were finally on this alternative flight we waited a further 1 hr as they proceeded to act like a passenger was missing. A deploy scam to ensure they suggest the flight took off exactly under the 3 hour delay protocol for compensation. I’m fuming and it ruined our enjoyable. Just horrible.

I have never had an issue despite travelling with Ryanair more than twenty times a year for more than twenty years. They are the number one airline in my opinion for selling you exactly what you want, in terms of priority boarding, priority seats, luggage options, etc. If you want something, you can pay for it. If you don't want something, don't pay for it. Simple enough. You can check in weeks before your flight, which means that you can print out both boarding passes at home. A lot more reasonable than airlines that make you wait until 24 hours before the flight (why?!) Most of the people I hear complaining about Ryanair don't follow the rules and then blame the airline for their own mistakes or oversights.

Our flight was 3.5 hours and the airline refused to even provide water unless you paid! What kind of service is that?

326,Adam Heng," Worst airline for countless reasons. 1) Flight delayed by six hours. We were scheduled to depart at 6.05pm. Everyone had boarded the aircraft by 6pm, but we were told by flight attendants to disembark due to a ""technical error on the plane"". The flight was rescheduled to 12 midnight, but it eventually only took off at around 1am the next day - a total of seven hours of delay. 2) Zero accountability. Ground staff were completely clueless as to any protocol in times of delay. Worse still, for the next ninety minutes or so there was no follow up action and all passengers were just stranded at the boarding gate. We were told to ""come check back every 30 min or so"" and there was no assurance of what would be done. 3) Shamelessly tried to shirk responsibility. We were told we could make claims via the EU261 flight regulation. However when I submitted my claim, the airline had the gall to say the flight was ""delayed due to air traffic controller restrictions, which was outside of our control"", which was totally opposite of the technical errors that the air crew had stated. 4) Poorest ever customer service. I followed up with Ryanair customer service staff who had zero professionalism. He was nonchalant throughout the correspondence. The incompetence of this staff member is highlighted in the fact he redirected me to the CAA UK site despite knowing my flight had departed from Spain, and that CAA does not serve cases where the flight departs from other EU member countries. Overall, I regret booking flights from a subpar company with service undeserving of any approval whatsoever. The rock-bottom standard is paralleled by its consistently plummeting stock price.

Cheap flights don’t offer enough incentive to deal with rude staff, uncomfortable seats and hidden fees galore. Paying 55 euro to do the most standard thing possible (which is just checking in) is completely ridiculous, at no point before flying was I told and many other people for that matter, that not checking in online will incur such an expensive fee.

350,Hala El Bouziri,"  Ryanair is the worst airline, because of all their hidden costs and porous policies from ticket purchasing, to check-in, to luggage policy. The staff at the airport is next-level rude and unhelpful. My boyfriend and I purchased our tickets about a month prior to our flight (it was a returning flight from Seville to Morocco), we arrived at the airport early enough to go through check-in and drop our bags only to be told that we have 2 minutes to check-in online when their website was not even responding for us to go through with it in addition to shaky airport Internet connection that was not helpful either. We went to see the company representative at the counter only to be received with a deaf ear. The lady tells us that we have to pay a 55 euro fee per person in addition to the luggage fine that goes up to 50 euros per person per extra luggage. When we tried to ask for a way to help us because we are literally stuck at the airport, she didn't even looked like she had the slightest bit of concern for our situation or even tried to find a way to help us, or direct us to someone that could. All she said was ""you gotta take it up with customer service"" when she was sitting inside the customer service booth at the airport. I know that I should've known better about Ryanair as today was NOT the first time a situation like such happened with them. I would never ever recommend this airline to anybody, you're better off paying the extra 20 or 30 euros to fly with a proper airline with an actual customer service, a real 21st century company that truly cares about their customers.

353,Laura Martints,"  Athens to Santorini. We did not have a good experience with flying on Ryanair. When we landed in Athens from the US we tried to go the desk to check in for our flight to Santorini four days later. However, the airline said it was too early and we could do so later. When we arrived for our flight we were told because we missed our window to check in (48 hours to 2 hours before the flight - we were there 1 hour and 55 minutes before) we would have to pay 60 euros each. We explained that they woudn't let us check in previously and they said they had sent us an email. We were on vacation and had taken a break from media. The staff was not kind or thoughtful, they just handed us a bill for 120 euros and sent us to another desk to pay if we still wanted to make the flight we had already purchased. To say the least we were quite upset about paying double for our flights that we had booked several weeks prior. When we left Santorini we had similar problems. The desk agent asked us for printed boarding passes. When we told her we didn't have access to a printer at our Air BnB she said it would be 30 euros per person to get a boarding pass. We could not believe that we were asked once again to pay more money on top of our ticket prices just to print out a boarding pass. She was unfriendly and handed us a ticket to go pay our bill. We asked if there was some other way around this and she said that if we wanted to step out of line and download the app. that was an option. So, even though we had been in the line since early that morning we stepped out of the line and downloaded the app. even though we really did not want this app on our cell phone. What a run around.

As many Ryanair flights fly out of Madrid, it took quite a while to complete bag drop, specifically around 50 minutes. The flight was delayed by about half an hour. As a budget airline, the flight was adequate, it felt safe, wasn’t particularly comfortable and pretty much delivered as expected... if not a little better. The seat was wider than expected, and staff were more helpful than I’d have thought. I wasn’t fond of the lack of a seat pocket, but it it did give me extra leg room so points to them for that. Seats are non-reclining because of course they would be and While the safety card being printed on the seatback is a clever idea to save weight and all, it’d be nice if they calmed down a little with all the yellow. I wonder how the new “game changer” seats would feel .. they look nicer, but do they also improve on comfort?

My ticket baggage allowance was 20kg x 3 bags total 60kg. At the counter, I wanted to check in 2 bags total weight of 50kg. The short hair woman at the Lisbon airport terminal 2 counter said I had to check in one more bag or I must pay £110.00 in excess baggage. Something about maximum per bag is 20kg and not more. I saw the baggage allowance policy online that you are able to pool your luggage together to make the allowed weight. But I decided to let it go and bought an empty luggage from the nearby shop for £120.00 to check in at a total weight of 53kg. What’s more, since I didn’t print my boarding pass I had to pay an additional £110.00 to check-in at the counter. Totally spent an extra of £230.00 for nothing at all.

364,Anna Maria Orani,"  I take several times per year the Ryanair flight from Nice to Dublin since 2016 (for working reasons), so my experience is rather big and I would say statistically significant! The flight time is late in the evening, the arrival in Dublin (depending on the season) is scheduled generally after 11 pm. The flight is constantly delayed, I think only 2 or 3 times the flight left at the right time according to my experience. This has often caused me serious problems as my final destination in Ireland is not Dublin but Galway, and the last bus I can catch is at 00.30. This means that several times I had to sleep at the airport and wait for the next bus (around 5.30 am). Many times I asked the flight crew if any options were available such as hotel accommodation (at least at a special price) or alternative transportation. Last time (a month ago) they offered a 4 euros snack coupon for a 2 and half hours delay, I did not know whether to laugh at their faces or cry!

By the time we got the bus into Rome and checked into our hotel, almost the entire day was gone meaning we only had two days in Rome.

370,T Parker," London Luton to Vilnius. I rang Ryan Air a full 14 days before my outbound flight to let them know that I would not be able to travel after all due to family/personal reasons. As I had paid for their optional 'one trip travel insurance' I told them that I would be claiming my flight costs back via the insurance policy. To cut a long story short: I was told that Ryanair has no cancellation policy and that I would have to wait for at least 24 hours after my return journey and then phone Ryanair again to request a 'Did Not Show' confirmation letter. This will form step one in the insurance claim process. As my return flight was booked for 10th November I, therefore, phoned Ryanair 12th November. They told me they will email me the necessary 'Did Not Show' letter and that I can expect this in the next 8 working days. I said that this was a ridiculously long time to wait, particularly when the customer service agent said she could see that I hadn't used the ticket and would, therefore, be instructing the DNS letter to be processed immediately. When I asked what the procedure was once I had received the DNS letter she said she did not know but was sure that instructions would be included in the email. My issues are: I informed Ryanair 24th October that I would not be using my ticket but was told that I could not start to claim back my flight costs until at least 2 days after my return flight. This meant there would be an empty seat travelling to Vilnius 7th November and an empty seat travelling back to Luton on 10th November. As Ryanair confirmed there was no way of cancelling my ticket/seat then I must assume those seats were left empty! That sounds like very bad commercial practice - not something I would expect of a low cost/budget airline. Ryanair offers 'one trip travel insurance' at the time of booking and then cannot explain the procedure for making a claim against the insurance policy. They blame it on the fact that their insurers are a 'third party'! Check! The transaction was made between me and Ryanair and I expect Ryanair to be responsible. I now have to wait possibly another 10 days simply to start the claiming process - a process which I am still in the dark about. How much longer will this take?

371,S Marton,"  Stansted to Fuertuventura. On the Ryanair website it states that you can have two pieces of hand luggage under 10kgs.

385,Christian Holmes,"  Return flight from Trieste to Stansted. I flew out with a soft hand luggage bag that I have used on countless Ryanair flights, including my outbound trip to Trieste where I was visiting for 3 days. Upon my return, I was made to pay €25 as my bag 'did not meet Ryanair's restrictions'- despite fitting comfortably within the measuring 'cage' that Ryanair staff use to assess whether luggage can or can't fit in the overhead compartments. Despite my bag fitting in the cage (and therefore meeting Ryanair's restrictions), my was deemed too long. Bear in mine this was not a hard-shell style bag but rather a soft leather bag i.e. malleable. The most frustrating part of this was that I had flown out with the same bag, hadn't purchased any additional items, and have used this bag on every flight I have ever taken with Ryanair. In spite of my explanation, the staff had clearly made up her mind and decided I should pay rather than use any sense of initiative. In short, well done Ryanair.

It said that an hour and a half before take-off wasn't enough time for on-line check-in. So I had to go to the 'Customer Service' desk and pay €55 for Ryanair to print out my boarding pass. I think this is an excessive amount of money for printing one piece of paper. in addition, the seats are quite uncomfortable. The gate was at the far end of the airport. By the time I got there, there was no time to get something to eat, so I had to buy food during the flight. I got beef lasagne for €6. The price was reasonable, but the food was almost inedible.

If I didn’t pay up, I wouldn’t have been allowed to fly. Total extortion. The check-in person said I must have got emails warning me of this charge but they would have gone to the person in my organisation who booked the ticket for me. In fairness, some Ryanair staff I spoke to were embarrassed by the policy. I complained after I paid my €55, but I got a pre-prepared statement in response.

397,Y Hanakov,"  Beauvais to Bratislava. I had two trouble free flights within last two weeks. The fares were very cheap. I purchased priority boarding, so had 2 cabin bags allowance. Website experience was good, the mobile application worked fine, and apple pay functionality was a big convenience. The only strange thing about website vs application experience is that when purchasing priority boarding you can not buy 10 kg checked bag allowance on the website. On mobile you can do this. Another thing to watch is cost of this service. It changes, and the price can double, so if you need it, it is better to buy it early. At the airport check-in desk was not overcrowded. Boarding was fast and efficient, with usual nasty waiting when priority line had to be formed on the stairs and then lined up near the plane. But flying low cost you have to accept this. Onboard everything was ok. Seats are passably comfortable. I purchased hot meal and it was tasty. Toilet condition was good. Departures and arrivals both times on schedule. I was able to read all the bad reviews, but as I can see most of them are written by the people who didn't follow rules and been fined for that. For me the main difference between legacy carriers and low cost is that legacy bring you to your destination whatever happens (they put you on different flight or on competition company or re-route you).

407,F Thompson," I am writing my second review for Ryanair and it is only my second time flying with them on a return flight. It is my first and last time flying with them! I strongly, strongly advise you to never ever fly with them on principle alone! Their baggage rules and deadlines are ridiculous. As a whole I paid an extra $162 Euros for a flight that was only supposed to be $94 Euros. In Canadian, that is almost $300 extra dollars so naturally I'm upset. The worst thing about this company is the complete lack of customer service. The carry-on I took to Madrid is built in the dimensions to fit all cabin flights. The exact same carry-on I took from Madrid to Porto was all of a sudden too big to return to Madrid. I tried to explain this to the staff member and the first thing she says to me is, ""I'm just doing my job, it's not my fault they weren't doing their job over there."" Note that this is the exact same company and the inconsistency is frustrating. She asked me to come with her and check the size and in my opinion it fit and she disagreed. I asked to talk to the supervisor who approached me with hostility and attitude. She called me ""baby"" and when I kindly asked her not to call me that she called me it three more times before I refused to speak to her. I went to another Ryanair desk and asked another staff member who must have been instructed by her supervisor to treat me poorly because I simply asked her, ""Where is your customer service desk please?"" All of her body language including rolling her eyes was rude and I asked her why she was giving me attitude when I asked a reasonable question. All she told me was ""third floor"" and when I asked for more specific details she was reluctant and rude the whole time. I followed her instructions just to be told by security that the Ryanair customer service was outside which this staff member did not mention. Not wanting to miss my flight, I opted to pay whatever fee they needed and was met with minimum information, being rushed and two people talking to me at once. Once said I had to pay 25 Euros and the other said I had to pay 50 Euros which I ended up paying with no print out receipt which I had received on the Madrid side. This company can not assume that everyone knows exactly how everything works and they need to learn to treat people reasonably if they are incapable of kindness. On my first experience with Ryanair I interacted with a total of 8 very poor employees the worst of which was the supervisor from Porto who called me ""baby"" after kindly being asked several times not to do that. This company needs to go out of business. They are not worth it. Please do not choose them!

On our return they were out of milk so when I paid £3 for my coffee they had no milk because it was their last trip as if that’s my fault. Crew members are rude and arrogant. When we asked to be seated together we were asked to pay extra and even then our seats were not guaranteed.

414,F Basula,"  Madrid to Porto. Worst airport experience I've ever had. I will preface this by saying I checked in almost 24hrs before my flight and that I have only ever missed a flight once before and United airlines got me on another flight no problem, no fee. I understand that it's your responsibility to not ""miss your flight"" but when I arrived one rep tried to respond to my distress and I believed was berated by another worker in Spanish and then worker became rude to me, one word answers, pointing to arbitrary directions. The next person I spoke to was also rude, I asked about my options and was only given 100Euro exchange of flight option. I asked to speak to a supervisor who essentially threw a pre-written customer service paper at me. I explained that I would just like help and would prefer to do it at the airport. He walked away and I had to follow him and ask again for a number. He again was short and pointed in a direction just saying ""there"". At this point I was very upset because customer service usually responds with sympathy and kindness even if nothing can be done. I waited in line and the initial female I spoke to was avoiding me. I had to insist on receiving a number from the other male rep who reluctantly gave me an incorrect number and did nothing further to help me after I showed him it didn't work. I had to search up a correct number online and at least the rep on the phone was more reasonable, but I will never ever fly Ryanair again. The cheaper fees are made up in baggage fees. You are  locked in once you make a purchase which was terrible because I would have rather paid 200 Euros extra to completely change to an airline that actually cares about their customers. Furthermore, I missed this flight due to confusion on Ryanair airs website and the language barrier. They should provide better instructions to the ridiculous setup at the airport, make it easier to find or provide a general direct address if possible! Lastly, they should actually try to help people and explain things in a reasonable way, preferably with more than one word answers. They're response was not due to language, they were rude from the boarding desk, to the help desk, and the supervisor was the worst of it.

417,A Dalina,"  The online booking system by Ryanair was causing random issues for me and they deny their faults. On booking this trip for November 2019, I've used the pre-defined flyers information saved in my settings and everything seemed alright upon payment. The confirmation email however was showing my family name as name of the main passenger (despite using the pre-defined passenger information as said), making it impossible to ""correct spelling mistakes for free"". I did call the customer service, and for two times the line was cut mysteriously making me spend additional 13 euros for a phone call, just to be told it's my fault that I didn't check that everything was alright before paying. I've had to buy a new ticket because it was cheaper than paying the fee for changing the passenger name. Of course they didn't want to refund the unused ticket either. Again, I was booking a flight for another person and added a checked-in baggage for an extra price of 50 Euros (25 per flight). I did check again that everything was alright when paying, and the confirmation email showed that I was only charged 49 euros (instead of 120) and the baggage was not added. Of course adding it at a later stage means paying 80 euros instead of 50.

419,Kalu Ijere,"  Dublin to Gatwick. Barely a minute when I left flight FR116 of 2nd October, 2019, seat no 32F, which was the second to the last seat to the rear cabin area of the plane ( and I was the only one sitting on the row) when I discovered that I have either left my wallet on the seat or it has dropped off on the floor. Earlier in the flight I hesitated changing one of my €50 note to buy £3 water and I told the female cabin crew member same. She asked me what coin I may have and I had €1.20 and she said she was sorry that it's not enough. So I think I mistakenly didn't put my wallet back in my pocket as I intended to. When I made to go back to the parked plane I was told by a security man that I cannot do that and he asked me to make a call on a phone he pointed down at the hall to let them know that I had left my wallet. I made the call and was told that I have to make the complain at the counter. I got to the Ryanair counter in less than 2 minutes and informed the Lady there of my missing wallet. She called someone and hung up and told me the person will call back in 10 minutes. 10 minutes went to 15 minutes and she called back again and was told that the cabin crew members had not found anything. The back n forth went for nearly 40 minutes with me calling customer service who gave me a phone number that hasn't gone through till today. As directed, I went to get the Lost property Contact since I was told that it takes 24 hours for a lost item to be reclaimed. My flight arrived Gatwick a few minutes past 5 but I ended up leaving the airport by 7:30pm because I didn't have money to pay for a taxi home and couldn't reach family that could help. My Credit and Debit Card, plus €101.20, £1 and Oyster card was in that wallet. Finally, a friend helped booked me a Taxi. I can't believe that my wallet disappeared into thin air.

420,V Garlen,"  I wish I could put zero stars. My family and I were flying from Menorca to Madrid over the summer. We got to the airport two hours before the flight. There was only one person at the counter doing the check in for the whole plane. We waited 1 hour and 20’ to be exact until we got to the counter. The person at the counter tells us we don’t have the boarding passes printed. We had our reservation print out but not our boarding passes, I had tried to do the check in the day before with no luck. Since I was traveling with scattered internet and no printer available, we assumed we would be able to check in at the airport but no. We were sent to another counter at the airport with a Ryanair supervisor who started to mistreat myself and my family. She said we had to paid €220 as a penalty for not having our boarding passes. Of course we were not happy about this but we handed out our credit card and asked her name or employee identification number so we can later make a complaint about her mistreat to the company. She did not like that. She refused to give that information as well as taking our Credit card saying ""Why should I give you my name, I don't have to"". After these unfortunate exchange with her. I grabbed my phone to see if I could find any way to get the boarding passes online. She accused me of taking a picture of her, which did not occur. I offered her to check my phone and confirm that I wasn’t filming or taking pictures (the airport police confirmed what I was saying was the truth later) and she refused to do that as well. Her assumption was wrong and decided to punish us denying to let us board on this plane or any future Ryanair flight. We asked for help, to see if we could talk to anyone else (any reasonable person), she refused to help or to refer us to any other place that we can address our concern, she wouldn’t talk to us. We asked for any airport authority or for the police to help us out to no avail or response from anyone. In our desperation for help since we were missing our flight my husband had to yell in the middle of the airport calling the police for help to be able to get some attention but no one came. Finally we went to a different company counter and asked them to please call the police for us, the finally called them. Not only we were humiliated by this person who showed abused of her authority but we had to buy new tickets for €1000 and got stuck at the airport for 9 hours for a total arbitrary decision of someone who couldn’t prove any bad behavior on our end.  The airport police finally came, we talked to them for a while, we were quite altered by the situation by then they said they could not give us any information of this person and had no authority on the flight since it was owned by a private company so they could not help us.

429,H Mansarya,"  Berlin to Madrid. Before explaining the bad experience that we had with this airline, I will mention that we missed over 1000 euros at the airport just because this airline forced us to do so. Well, the low price of this flight naturally attracts you when you are booking your ticket, but if you know for different unreasonable reasons that you might have never heard before in your life they will charge you over 1000 euros and does not let you get into your flight, you might change your mind. With my family, we were traveling from Berlin to Madrid, and since we had check-in luggage, I decided to not do online check-in. We were among the first people that went to the check-in desk and there, they told us that we should have done online check-in 3 minutes ago at the latest and now we have to pay 55 euros per person for them to do the check-in. So we paid this money, and again we were among the first people who were at the gate to go to the airplane. When they were checking our boarding pass, they said that there was a problem with one of our check-in luggage and we can not get into the plane! (Later they never informed us what was the problem.) When I tried to convince them that they have to wait for us to solve the problem, their crew rudely shouted at me! They told us to go to the Ryanair desk at the airport (SXF) and there they told us that this is not their responsibility and there is no one there to help us, and all we can do is writing a complaint letter! The only option they gave us, and they believed that we have to be thankful about that, was paying 100 euros per person and get new tickets for the day after, and since I was with my family and had no other reasonable choices, I had to pay more money and book the ticket.  After all, they destroyed our vacation, and we had a lot more additional costs for the hotel and all other expenses to spend the night in Berlin.

430,Rishi Weidum,  Brussels to Milan. It is unfortunate that Ryanair dont read the complaints fully. It states we checked in online a day in advance! We have not received our boarding passes. So we arrived at the airport 2.5 hours early! To get our boarding passes at the airport employees send us in 3 different lines and said they could not give us a boarding pass cause the system said we already checked in and should have received our boarding passes.

431,L Zhang," Rome to Seville. “Beaten on the spot” I’m not a regular flyer of Ryanair and thus have never noticed their change of policy about the checking in and the hand luggage. With a mentality that it’s similar to other airlines, I thought I could do the check-in on the spot. When I arrived at the desk, the staff told me that I had to do the check-in online and cannot do it any more now. Then I was told that I have to go to the ticketing office upstairs to pay 55 euro for the check-in and come back to him. He also told me, “You can jump the queue and come to me once you have paid.” Then I showed him my 6,9 kg hand luggage suitcase, then he told me, “You cannot bring this on board and you have to do check-in luggage. For this, you need to pay 25 euro.” Hearing this, I was very shocked. I told the staff, “This is furbo (cheating), if a person travels for the first time with this airline and does not know the regulations, he/she has to pay extra or even more than the actual ticket.” Having no choice, I went to the ticketing office. While waiting for the staff to do my check-in, a gentleman arrived breathlessly as he was running to the desk to see if the staff can help him as the departure time of his plane had changed but he did not get any notification. The staff coldly said, “No, the gate has already closed.” The gentleman asked, “Could you do anything?” The staff replied, “I’m sorry, I can do nothing.” After paying my 80 euro, I went downstairs to the same desk and to the same staff who asked me to go to pay. Then he printed out my ticket. My questions are that, “Isn’t he working at the same desk, doing the same procedures of checking in? Why can’t he print the ticket before I made the payment and can print it after I paid?” A thought crossed my mind that “This airline lives on fine and on taking advantage of those who have no or less knowledge?” There’s blame on my part for not knowing that I have to do online check-in earlier but there’s also the cunning/cheating part of Ryanair.",Economy Class,n,2019-09-28,rome seville beaten spot regular flyer ryanair thus never noticed change policy checking hand luggage mentality similar airline thought could check spot arrived desk staff told check online told go ticketing office upstairs pay euro check come back also told jump queue come paid showed kg hand luggage suitcase told bring board check luggage need pay euro hearing shocked told staff furbo cheating person travel first time airline know regulation pay extra even actual ticket choice went ticketing office waiting staff check gentleman arrived breathlessly running desk see staff help departure time plane changed get notification staff coldly said gate already closed gentleman asked could anything staff replied sorry nothing paying euro went downstairs desk staff asked go pay printed ticket question working desk procedure checking print ticket made payment print paid thought crossed mind airline life fine taking advantage le knowledge blame part knowing online check earlier also cunning cheating part ryanair,-0.6908,Negative,1016
432,Rhys Taylor,"  Terrible experience on the flight from Rome to Lisbon (FR2692 @ 14:20 on the 16/9/2019). We went to weigh our bags before the flight just to make sure and were surprised to find all our bags registered as ‘over weight, please pay €40’ even my wife’s tiny handbag was registered as ‘over weight’. It was obviously set to charge customers regardless and shows how underneath and conniving Ryanair really is. The staff at our gate entrance was very very rude and made us pay for our cabin bags at the time we felt most vulnerable to get onto the flight. ‘You either pay now, or you miss your flight’. Apparently ‘the rules had changed’ despite flying with the same luggage with the same airline to get to Rome (also not an issue with the same cabin bags on multiple flights). She also refused to give us her name and said they would send us a receipt of the extra €50 we had to pay for our baggage. We are still yet to receive this. Not to mention they didn’t notify us of these baggage dimension changes until the day before when it was obviously too late for us to change, as this was a connecting flight, and despite the fact we had already paid for a flight with cabin bags included. On the flight, my wife and I were needlessly split up as were a lot of passengers which left us all grumpy but no where near as grumpy as the horrible staff. Where my wife was sat there was dried blood around the seat. She also needed to use the bathroom, which was filthy and covered in urine. When she enquired as to a better option, the attendant locked the door of the dirty toilet and simply opened a previously locked bathroom. What was the point of having that option locked to customers for Ryanair’s convenience rather than the customers? Delays with our bags at the other end too. Lesson learned, avoid Ryanair at all costs. They advertise as cheap but after adding the other costs they try to rip you off with it ends up more than an actual decent flight.

438,J Banscher,"  Frankfurt to Valencia. I cannot find any positive aspect of traveling with Ryanair. 1. Booking System of Ryanair: it is as shitty as you expect it to be from a low cost airline. The prices seem to appear low at first sight but in the end you end up with ruffly the same amount as with other airlines. They try to sell you so much shit you don't need. Like it was worth being in boarding group 1, going through a ""fast lane Check in""... In the end you just wait as long as everyone else because it doesn't make the whole boarding faster, but Ryanair sends you Emails saying ""better buy it, don't lose time at the airport, board hands free,..."" putting you under pressure to buy all the extras. Why would you need to book extra ""sitting together""? Despite the fact that you are able to spend 2 hours in a plane without sitting together and if needed kindly ask one of the other passengers to change seats. Ryanair's seat booking system could easily make you sit next to each other but it doesn't do it on purpose so you spend again extra 7€ or more just to sit to your beloved. All buttons on Ryanair's website which say something like ""add to card"" are highlighted but the ones which say ""skip"" are not just to make you feel you need to buy stuff. 2. The actual flight: In the airplane the whole tables are screwed to the seat so customers can't eat from them and the seats got no bags for your laptop etc. so Ryanair ""saves time"" during the cleanup for the next flight. Of course they always have some ""special offers"" in the air and they disturb you several times wanting you to buy parfumé or other stuff that you ""need right now"". 3. And what's about the luggage thing?! It always was a wired thing in every airline but Ryanair took it to another level. As it would matter if 2 kg too much on the luggage are taken out and put in your hand luggage, it's still on the same airplane?! Ryanair changed the policy of luggage in November 2018. So a normal hand luggage (55x40x20) that counts for every other airline is considered to be normal luggage for Ryanair now. And of course everyone who takes his old loved hand luggage now to the boarding gate is stopped by Ryanair and charged 25€ extra. So by bearing everything written in here in mind I cannot book any flights with Ryanair anymore and I don't recommend it to everyone else who are thinking about it.

439,V Victoria ,"  Don't be fooled by their low cost flights. With the delays they have, you'll end up spending more in an airport.

441,Samantha Bennett,"  Barcelona to Berlin. I recently took my first flight with Ryanair. When I purchased my flight I added the priority 10kg bag for the extra 13€ each way. When I first got to the airport they informed me that my bag was too big. They told me the fee for oversized baggage was 40€ but I mentioned that I had purchased the priority bag and asked if that fee could be deducted from the oversized bag fee. They were very rude and blunt and told me ""too bad, it is your own fault."" In total I ended up paying 106€ round trip just for my bags. My second issue was when I got an email the night before my return flight informing me that Ryanair was on strike and to show up to the airport 3 hours before my flight, so we did. However, the flight still took off 1.5 hours later than scheduled. After arriving home, we quickly grabbed our bags and went home. When unpacked my bag later that night noticed the entire bottom of my suitcase was cracked and broken. This is a brand new high-quality suitcase and it can no longer be used. I tried to email Ryanair followed by multiple phone calls and attempting to use their 'chatbot', to no avail. So I followed up every single day for the next five days, emailing, calling and trying the chatbot. They also charge for every call to their customer service center (yes, it’s true) so I racked up quite a bill just trying to get ahold of someone. The customer service phone reps all told me different things: one person said I would have to contact the airport and ask them how I would get a reference number since I didn't do it when I arrived, another told me it could only have been done at the time of arrival, and another person just told me to fill out a contact form online with pictures attached. Calling the phone numbers I was given were either disconnected numbers or just a loop of automated voice options which lead you back to the original menu options or tell you where to look online. Dealing with their customer service was a loop of confusion and mixed messages, and my time for filing claims ran out. It’s impossible for customers to get a hold of customer service or file claims just so they do not have to deal with the issues that arise.",Economy Class,n,2019-09-23,barcelona berlin recently took first flight ryanair purchased flight added priority kg bag extra way first got airport informed bag big told fee oversized baggage mentioned purchased priority bag asked fee could deducted oversized bag fee rude blunt told bad fault total ended paying round trip bag second issue got email night return flight informing ryanair strike show airport hour flight however flight still took hour later scheduled arriving home quickly grabbed bag went home unpacked bag later night noticed entire bottom suitcase cracked broken brand new high quality suitcase longer used tried email ryanair followed multiple phone call attempting use chatbot avail followed every single day next five day emailing calling trying chatbot also charge every call customer service center yes true racked quite bill trying get ahold someone customer service phone rep told different thing one person said would contact airport ask would get reference number since arrived another told could done time arrival another person told fill contact form online picture attached calling phone number given either disconnected number loop automated voice option lead back original menu option tell look online dealing customer service loop confusion mixed message time filing claim ran impossible customer get hold customer service file claim deal issue arise,-0.743,Negative,1356

452,C Macallin,"  Hamburg to Dublin. I fly with Ryanair once or twice a week over 40 weeks of the year. Going forward from my experience today only because they are cheap. And they are a horribly cheap airline with an absolutely horrible customer service. I had a problem checking in via their on line app this afternoon. As a result I ran past their check in deadline time. I rang their service team who told me to go to their service desk at Hamburg. Long story short they charged my €55 to check in. I now know their charges on late check in but there was absolutely no empathy for my issue. No flexibility and couldn’t care less. It was about getting money from me.

Ryanair website would not let us check in,  on arrival asked staff they tried to help but could check us in online either, got directed to the desk where I had to pay £55 x 4 for 4 Traveler because of there computer systems, £55 for a person to print a boarding pass = £220. Then later got to gate and was told to pay £25 for my luggage. Thankfully on my return fly I came back with Norwegian, a total contrast, they where willing to check luggage for free and had free wifi on plane, printed boarding pass with no extra cost.

We are family of four travel back from Istanbul, unfortunately, the last leg was Ryanair from CPH. This review may be useful for other readers not to get caught by Ryan Air at the gate where they completely rip you off. Firstly when they allocate the seats while we were on holiday they put the family members in completely different locations so to get seats allocated to sit together you need to pay £8 per seat. My 12-year-old daughter when her birthday still in December they say she is 13 and need to sit on her own. We got the boarding pass while we were on holiday by kiwi.com and boarding pass says, if you need to carry 2 cabin bags you need to buy priority but one cabin bag is allowed and standard sizes are mentioned. In the checking desk, they check your bag says only small cabin bag is allowed which is much smaller than the standard size and ask you to pay 25 Euro per bag that is Euro 100 for my family. I should have easily got much better airline for that amount of extra money. So readers, do not fly Ryanair they will con you to your last penny to make money. You can just pay a little bit extra and have a good flight with no headache.

479,Charlie Lewis,"  Barcelona to Cardiff. I have never experienced such a terrible flying experience than I did yesterday, 27th August with Ryanair. Firstly from having to pay €110 for not checking in online. Then greeted at the departure gates at 8:45am and not being allowed to board the plane as the “gates were closed”. We were then told to go to the Ryan Air office and when we asked where it was located we were simply told “downstairs”, no directions or help offered and we were expected to carry all of our luggage back to the very entrance of Barcelona airport. When we got there, there was quite a long queue for the Ryan Air desk. We were told that they couldn’t do anything for us as there were no flights available until the 31st of August which would have meant waiting 4 days due to a strike. Therefore we had to travel to another airport an hour away from there and board another flight with a different airline. We were not offered any compensation and I am disgusted with the service we received and it is safe to say that they have lost our custom as we will never use this airline again. Not only did we lose out on the money we payed for the original flight but also the money we had to pay for the check-in service also.

480,L Lever,"  My husband and I attended a wedding in Tuscany and had bad experiences on both our outbound and return flights from Stansted to Pisa. Ryanair staff in both Stansted and Pisa, were extremely rude with multiple passengers complaining about a rude member of ground staff from our outbound flight from Stansted. Ryanair have a policy where you must to pay a £25 charge if you choose to bring  a small roll on luggage for which there is ample room for and can be easily stored in the overhead locker on the aircraft. The £25 is due if you do not pay for ‘Priority boarding’ that allows you to carry on a small bag and roll on luggage for £8 ; for which there are only a limited number of spaces available and is almost always sold out. My husband was required to pay this fee and was also told by a member of staff, that he has been ignorant and had obviously ‘ignored’ his emails - which was not the case. If not there is the option to check in a 10kg case for the price of £20.40 each way. Which amounts to £40.80, for only a long weekend away. Apart from the extra costs that were not clear to me on the Ryanair website or app.  As we were at Pisa airport and boarding the plane I was given a telling off from one of the Pisa Ryanair staff for trying to assist them as we were one of the last to board by attaching the luggage tag to my husbands small roll-on luggage after we had paid the £25 fee for it (that we would now have to wait for at the baggage carousel at London Stansted airport, despite finding out that there was more than enough room for it inside the overhead lockers when we boarded the plane) and repeatedly asked ‘Why, Why, Why?!’ I had possibly attached the tag to the bag, which is completely acceptable in the UK, to which I responded that ‘I was trying to help as I could see they were tight on time’ and told firmly ‘not to do it, that is not good and Why would you do that?’. We are disgusted by the way we have been treated by Ryanair staff and by all of the extra costs that were added. We were drawn to the airline due to the flights being the cheapest at the time, however would rather pay more for a professional, courteous service without the extra costs. After calculating these costs, e, this worked out as more expensive than other airlines that we did not book with due to the fact that Ryanair seemed cheaper. Please, do your research before booking with this airline and if you would like to be treated professionally and in a courteous manner and avoid paying for things that should be and are included with other airlines... then do not book with Ryanair.

We were worried about getting back to STN on the 24 Aug because of the pilot strike.

485,Marcin Buciak,"  Warsaw to Stockholm Skavsta. We had an average flight on Ryanair. Very cheap ticket. As for a cheap airline, the staff didn’t care and they were sitting on their seats and doing nothing. Legroom wasn’t that bad.

Very unfriendly staff who looked miserable from start to finish. As an anxious flyer, a smile can make all the difference. Absolutely no room on the aircraft, felt like a pack of sardines, virtually no comfort. There were a group of men drinking beer standing at the front end of the aircraft for nearly the whole duration of the flight which I thought was odd and unsettling. Also, you can not hear what anyone is saying on the speaker, pilot or cabin crew. The worst part was the heat! Aircon was useless and it seemed that everyone has was struggling with the heat.

489,P Helimas,"  Manchester to Rhodes. Ryanair is by far the most atrocious, extortionate budget airline out there right now and here are three reasons why. They’ve introduced a completely senseless baggage policy, that amounts to no more than a money making cheat scheme, they’ll charge you for a small suitcase, should it have wheels, even if it meets the measurement criteria for cabin luggage.  They’ll separate two companion travellers, despite them having booked their tickets together, as a means of forcing people to purchase reserved seats. 3) Finally, they employ or train the rudest staff (in my experience - and I have travelled widely), because they respond to complaints with an utter lack of empathy. So, I’m afraid I feel obliged to leave this scathing review and I can only hope that Ryanair will take heed and change for the better.",Economy Class,n,2019-08-24,manchester rhodes ryanair far atrocious extortionate budget airline right three reason introduced completely senseless baggage policy amount money making cheat scheme charge small suitcase wheel even meet measurement criterion cabin luggage separate two companion traveller despite booked ticket together mean forcing people purchase reserved seat finally employ train rudest staff experience travelled widely respond complaint utter lack empathy afraid feel obliged leave scathing review hope ryanair take heed change better,-0.6901,Negative,525
490,P Morris," Faro to London Southend. I cannot stress enough do not fly with Ryanair. We paid for priority boarding. There was no sign of priority boarding, it was a complete free for all when it came to getting on the plane from the holding area at the gate. There was an issue to the rear of the plane, everyone waiting to get onboard to the rear were left airside by the runway for around 30 minutes with no explanation while the front continued to board. We paid extra to book seats so we could all sit together as we have 3 young children. Got on the plane we found 3 of our 5 our booked seats were ripped up. We weren’t told as we got on the plane there was an issue and there were no signs on the seats, when we asked what was happening the flight attendant was rude and said the reason they were like that was they were obviously out of use and he’d have to find somewhere else once everyone else was sat down. I had to stay in our 2 of our booked seats with my eldest and my wife had to sit at the front of the plane away from me with my two youngest on her own. It was a really bad end to our holiday. I contacted Ryanair customer service to complain that two of the key services I’d paid extra for on our return flight hadn’t been fulfilled, the customer service advisor was rude and arrogant and advised me in their T&C’s you accept at the end that basically they can remove priority boarding and booked seats without explanation and we accept that when booking even if you have paid extra for it.

491,Colum Mckeown," Manchester to Belfast with Ryanair. We had to change flight and they charged me 150 pounds to change a flight which cost 50 pounds, not to mention the 40 pounds I was charged to make the phone call to their customer service team. I had to make 5 phone calls as 4 times the customer service person deliberately hung up on me, which I assume also helps the boost revenue on their premium phone line. Unbelievable. Also they put my child in a seat away from me, even though by law a 6 year old should be seated beside an adult. Do they now expect to charge people for what they are required by law to do? I then had to listen to a flight attendant scream at two passengers because they were not paying full attention to her while the did her life vest demonstration. Her exact words were “if I have to do this you will pay attention to me or I will remove you”. I don’t think a flight attendant has the power to force a passenger to watch her do the demo or through them off the plane.

We had already paid £88 (on top of the cost of are flights) to pre book our seats so we could sit together but then to board the plane and a lady who refused to move was sitting in one of the seats. On our way home we were sitting in front of two very drunk passengers who boarded the plane like that and were served more alcohol the whole flight by the cabin crew (who couldn't bring a lady beside me a spoon to feed her baby for an hour because they were busy) and began to smoke a e-cigarette which cabin crew could see and smell but decided to turn a blind eye.

I reminded her what she said last time about the two bags being okay to bring onboard, but she denied saying that and then started to argue with me. I stopped talking to her as she was very rude. She then kicked me out the line and said I need to stand in another if I need help. Eventually I spoke with another Ryanair lady who was very kind and explained what had happened.

In fact I would choose this airline again at the expense of some other low cost airlines and/or flag carriers. The flight - and cabin crew is safety conscious and efficient, I exchanged pleasantries with the mostly hungarian crew upon leaving the plane as well. I think being nice to the crew goes a long way, as they are working hard with very short turnaround times. The seats feel more like jump seats but that's ok for a short haul flight. Don't have any comments on the catering as I didn't have the need to use it. The ground service varies between airports - the priority boarding is perhaps not worth the money so much as some people still end up cutting the line.

510,D Gill,"  Stansted to Brno. I was expecting an horrendous experience, but the flights there and back were fine. Ryanair's pricing policy, and what you can optionally pay for, is transparent. The basic fare is incredibly cheap, but once you add any extras, such as luggage, extra legroom, self-assigned seating, and so on, the price rockets, and the airline is quite clear on this. It's also clear on luggage restrictions, and penalties for not checking in online. My main criticism is that boarding, especially at Stansted, was chaotic: queuing down a stairwell, and then waiting a good 10 minutes on the tarmac in blistering heat. Why doesn't boarding begin when the aircraft is ready? Seats OK for a short-haul, cabin staff did their job. The experience on Jet2 and EasyJet is better, but Ryanair did what its tin promises.",Economy Class,y,2019-08-03,stansted brno expecting horrendous experience flight back fine ryanair pricing policy optionally pay transparent basic fare incredibly cheap add extra luggage extra legroom self assigned seating price rocket airline quite clear also clear luggage restriction penalty checking online main criticism boarding especially stansted chaotic queuing stairwell waiting good minute tarmac blistering heat boarding begin aircraft ready seat ok short haul cabin staff job experience jet easyjet better ryanair tin promise,0.3976,Neutral,510
511,Megan Burnett,"  Stansted to Aarhus. Arrived and checked in very easy in Stansted. I was a little overweight with my check in but the staff member didn’t say anything. Was very pleasant. However had I have been charged then I would have paid since I know the luggage limit - as does everyone else. Flight said delayed by 50 mins. But then suddenly that was taken away & we were no longer delayed. Took us by surprise we had to dash to the gate. Didn’t weigh my hand luggage which was allowed to 10kg but it was actually about 15kg. Which I would have sucked up and paid had they weighed and told me. Since it’s my problem not there’s. They lay it out very clearly what the limit is so I don’t know why people complain at being charged extra. Flight arrived in Aarhus on time after taking off ontime. Bags were on the belt  after passport control. Flight coming in was very very bumpy due to the weather but the pilot did very well to land so smooth. Flight home from Aarhus was again on time and actually arrived about 25 mins early. So we must have had good wind on our side. The leg room is minute. I am 5’7 and pretty chubby & it was a struggle for my legs. My knees got bashed every time the person in front moved. The seats are ok, since Ryanair are a short haul company no one is going to break their backs on the seats. Friendly staff and a good clean cabin. Not dated like some airlines. I am terrified of flying but felt no more unsafe with them than I do with everyone else.  My flight was about £25 return and baggage was £30 each way - similar for all baggage costs.

515,P Measen,"  Strasbourg to Stansted. We were unlucky to have an aborted take off due to possible bird-strike and the plane returned to stand. The pilot kept the passengers and cabin crew well informed when on the ground, even connecting the APU to keep us comfortable. It was decided that we should disembark with all hand luggage whilst an engineer was called to inspect the engine, and for any damage to be repaired and then signed off. This did take some time, and passengers were required to wait in the gate departure area until the Police des Frontières had given permission for us (as a 'departed' international flight) to move into a larger area where there was a café. 5 € vouchers were issued and the café coped well with an additional and unexpected 189 passengers who were on the ground for over 3 hours. The only frustrating part of our time in Strasbourg was the time delay in getting the permission from the Police des Frontières and the lack of information ... not the fault of Ryanair, or the airport, which is an outstation without official Ryanair base representation only efficient and pleasant subcontractors. Ultimately engineers arrived and inspected the engine. The aircraft was signed off as safe to fly and we re-boarded with the same crew. The flight back was safe, uneventful and everyone was glad to be home. It is very easy to knock Ryanair for various aspects of their terms and conditions, but when it comes to safety they are second to none, and the responsible action by the flight deck, even though it involved a wait, shows what really matters in safe travel these days. And no, even with 'bird scaring' patrols, there is no guarantee that the little blighters will not come back to the same spot once the vehicle has gone.

We figured we'd just do it at the airport because the site said we can check in with them up to 40 minutes before departure. Upon arriving to the airport, they wanted £55 each to complete check-in! The rude customer service representative in Stansted informed us that it states so in their ""Terms and Conditions"" but it isn't clearly stated on their site.

519,S Milton,"  Gran Canaria to Stansted. Ryanair is now just a complete joke and pretty identical to the airlines depicted in come fly with me. Working out whether you’ve paid for luggage or not is deliberately unclear and I’d paid for only one way. You are deliberately seated apart, regardless of when you check in so you have to pay to sit together. Over two thirds of the plane had paid for priority boarding that comes with hand luggage so the queue was as long as if they hadn’t. The team are completely disorganised and ended up rushing through on both flights despite not having to wait for any passengers, to avoid the departure slot. If I had a pound for every time someone arbitrarily needed to “see” my boarding pass, without actually viewing it, I could’ve saved the £100 of additional hidden baggage fees. Over £700 pounds to take a small hand luggage each and to have the audacity to want to sit with my partner in the equivalent of a supermarket deck chair. This is not budget. At all. I flew to four destinations in the states last year, totalling six flights and that cost £2k. They’ve monopolised the European destinations and have taken over airports so now they can charge whatever they like. If it’s in any way possible to get some European sun without using them any more, I will try my damnedest.

520,Jeffrey Wall,"  Billund to Manchester. I'm a veteran flyer, but this week's flight was my first experience with Ryanair, and will be my last. The website, which I tried to access from my cell two days before the flight, would not allow me to complete check-in. When I got to the airport a little less than two hours before the flight, I was charged an extra $95 for not checking in early. A male flight attendant was quite rude to me, and I did not do anything to warrant that. He seemed more interested in chatting up the female flight attendants than helping passengers. Once a passenger has booked a ticket, which I did months in advance, they e-mail you every day with annoying offers and irrelevancies. I did not unsubscribe because it would have prevented me from getting important flight updates.

521,Jo O’Connor,"  Stansted to Arrecife. So, the flight was slightly cheaper than EasyJet, and the times were better, so I thought it was a good idea to give Ryanair a whirl, but then I realised at Check in that we had to pay to sit together. It didn’t bother me whether we did or not, so I didn’t bother with that, but couldn’t then check in until 48 hrs before the flight and had to print my boarding pass (eboarding pass not available). So, effectively, unless you are going somewhere with a printer, or for less than 48 hrs you had to book seats ahead, and therefore pay for them on the flight home! Then, as the tickets weren’t priority (?), we had to pay for our bags on the way back (5 x £25 = £125 + £39 for the seats added £164 onto our bill). On top of this, the staff talked to us like we were stupid. Another customer, who was having the same issue was furious, and the staff were equally rude to him. To top it all off, the flight was delayed by half an hour without a mention or apology, the air hostess told us we had to give her our rubbish half an hour before landing or take it home, as she wanted to get home too! And then the luggage handlers broke one of our cases after paying for the privilege of putting it in the hold against my will. I fly regularly (mainly around Germany) for work, and I have never had these issues. Definitely sticking to EasyJet for this route.

Therefore booked 2 bags, 1 for outbound, 1 for inbound. Completed the check-in process and the 2 bags are showing on the inbound / return journey?

537,J King," Edinburgh to Luxembourg. I have had problems with Ryanair multiple times before. First problem appeared when some of our wedding guests were not able to show at the ceremony as Ryanair suddenly changed the flight dates. Another time we paid for priority boarding. We crossed the gate amongst the priority passengers. Instead of letting priority passengers enter the plane first and then admit other passengers on the board they let everyone pass at the same time. Then today on our flight to Luxembourg we arrived 2 hours before the flight, scanned our passes through security and waited 100 meters from the gate. 30 minutes before the flight we approached the gate. There were no passengers left, only the staff. Then we were told we were two minutes late at the gate and they already deleted us from the passenger list so we won't be able to get on that flight. Staff were very rude and not helpful at all. Never in my life have I experienced such terrible customer service. Usually the boarding doesn't finish up until just before departure! There was no final call announced for the flight, our names were not called! The staff were awful and the only thing they could say was ""you won't get on that plane"". They expect customers to pay all these extras for seating together, cabin luggage, I won't be surprised if they start charging for using a toilet during the flight! But when it comes to be understanding to customers who pay money for the service, they just do not care. I would understand if we had been late and the plane had been starting the engines and preparing for departure, but we could actually see people still entering the plane from the window!

With only two desks open and well over 150 people waiting in line, we waited for an hour before we got to the front of the line and were told, as Canadians without an EU passport, we had to go somewhere else to get out boarding passes and then return back into line to check our baggage. What a joke. Where was an employee telling people this for the last hour!? So unprofessional and not the way to run an airline check in. I will not be flying with this airline again and will not recommend it to anyone.

547,John Philpotts,"  My wife and I were due to fly from Porto to Stansted with Ryanair. We had already flown to Porto with them and there were no problems and we arrived in plenty of time for the Flight passing through immigration and going to the gate. When we tried to board the plane the Ryanair employee said we could not fly. We asked why and she said my wife needed her boarding pass approved as she was not an EU Citizen. I tried to point out that my wife had a UK permanent residency card, but she refused to look and told us to ""stand over there or I will call the police"". As the plane was close to leaving, I approached her again and got the same threat. Finally after the plane left she and her colleague took us down a ramp opened a door and told us to go through. She slammed the door behind us and laughed as she left with her colleague. We were back in arrivals. As a result we had to stay overnight in Porto and book flights back to London City the next day, then train and bus back to Stansted. All in all an awful experience. I have complained to Ryan Air since September. First they acknowledged the claim and gave me a pass code to monitor it on their website. The latter was not recognized so I emailed them. No response for 7 months to numerous emails. I finally wrote to the MD in Ireland and received an email asking for copies of our travel documents, which I sent the same day. 7 days later I emailed again asking them to acknowledge receipt ... no answer. After another 7 days they emailed me to say I had not replied to their email. I replied and forwarded the original emails again one again asking for a reply. To date nothing. All I can say is that Ryanair should be ashamed of their employees action and their level of customer support which is 0.

548,Marie Petrova,"  Kiev to Stansted. I used to fly this airline many times before and took this tolerant as I understand that this is a budget airline, but this would be the last time me and my friend are flying with this airline ever. The cost of the ticket is small when you buy it many weeks before, if you buy few days before it increases by almost every minute but okay, can take that, but then the online check in closes 3-4 hours before your departure and if you didn’t check in and printed off your boarding pass, you gotta pay 55€ at the airport for you to check in on the flight that might have costed you 10€ or 200€ on the same flight same seat just if gotten later and this is without the luggage. The luggage costs another 30-50€. And also, if your on-board bag is bigger than supposed to be by few sm, you pay another 25€. The airplane is extremely uncomfortable, the seats are uncomfortable. The flights are late on boarding and the customer service and the service on board are very low as well. So it might turn up that you actually pay more, than flying on normal airline. Me and my many friends decided never to fly with Ryanair again, rather pay more for a comfort normal airline and never worry that you might be charged on top or you might be late without them saying sorry.

550,James Michaels,"  Another good experience with Ryanair. Great price on the ticket. Flight was pretty much on time. Staff were nice. Boarding was fairly smooth but involved a bit of queuing up, this is by no means unique to Ryanair though. Plane was new, and seats were the thin type which means you have a passable amount of legroom. Had food on board - selection was actually good, price was reasonable and quality was ok. I just don't understand why so many people still criticise this airline - you're paying budget prices - what do you expect? Just don't be an idiot and turn up with excess baggage or having not checked in. Ryanair must send about 10 reminders about this, but some people seem to still miss it. Or, they figure they will just do it anyway, and then stamp their feet to get an exception - don't bother - you're just wasting your time and money, and you will stress yourself out. My two detractors are 'priority' is not really priority these days, because half the plane has it, it should really be seen as a cabin suitcase surcharge, and I think Ryanair may as well just rename it as that. Also, if you have young kids, probably not the best choice because you will probably have to queue up a bit and use a bus to get from the gate to the plane.",Economy Class,y,2019-06-21,another good experience ryanair great price ticket flight pretty much time staff nice boarding fairly smooth involved bit queuing mean unique ryanair though plane new seat thin type mean passable amount legroom food board selection actually good price reasonable quality ok understand many people still criticise airline paying budget price expect idiot turn excess baggage checked ryanair must send reminder people seem still miss figure anyway stamp foot get exception bother wasting time money stress two detractor priority really priority day half plane really seen cabin suitcase surcharge think ryanair may well rename also young kid probably best choice probably queue bit use bus get gate plane,0.8658,Positive,702

Outbound flight left on time, return flight used an air-bridge at departure airport - it's the 1st time I encountered this with this airline. This delayed the boarding process a lot, as people were only entering from the front and trying to swap seats in order to sit with their friends/partners/families and they were doing that with their hand luggage, causing a delay of departure of almost 50' (landing 20' late). Majority of the passengers had bought priority, so it's not really priority.

There was not the same sales sales sales as there was on a previous flight to Malta and the staff dimmed the cabin lights so children could get some sleep.

567,Kay Smith,"  Vienna to  Stansted. I thought that the first time I had the following experience with Ryanair it was some sort of anomaly- oh was I wrong. Ryanair would not send me electronic boarding passes for me and my family. We had to arrive at check in and get those printed. We waited in the luggage drop off/check in line and waited for 20 min. We were given a slip of paper and sent to another line. This line took an hour. Several people in line missed their flights. When we got to our turn in this line, Ryanair for the 2nd time (once previously in Barcelona) accused me of not checking in and tried to charge 50 Euro fees per person to check in. Luckily, both times I had the app downloaded with proof that everyone had been checked in. The worker at the desk in Vienna made some phone calls and they “waived the fee”. We made it through security and once to the gate things were hectic again. The Ryanair attendants were treating a couple from India quite terribly, accusing the woman of having a fake visa. This went on well into our boarding time before someone took the couple away. The young woman was visibly upset at the accusations and other passengers were upset with the way she was treated - regardless of her visa status. When the flight landed in London and people got off the plane, there wasn’t a clear direction to go. I have video of a plane full of people walking around the plane wondering where to enter the airport. Overall, terrible experience.

569,J Carlson,"  Ryanair are the worst carrier I’ve flown. Recently I flew from Manchester to Marrakesh and Lisbon to Manchester so my information is up to date. It’s as if Ryanair sets out to test is customers at every step from booking to check in to the moment you get off the plane and are finally free of them. Let’s start with priority boarding. Don’t bother as you will end up queuing in a stairwell with everyone else once you get through the gate. At Manchester we waited for half an hour in a stair way. Some of the older customers were really struggling. We should have been kept at the gate until they were actually ready for us to board. The same happened in Lisbon but this time we were left waiting by the runway with the fumes of the planes blasting over us. Ok then the seats.... the single worst seats I’ve ever sat in on a plane. Rock hard, plastic covered monstrosities. They won’t even tilt back. Awful. The seats actually cause pain. By the time you get on the plane the customers have lost all sense of composure. Their nerves are shot and they are boiling over with anger at the service that they have received. This causes an underlying feeling that someone is going to lose it and kick off.

She asked me to put my luggage next to my hand luggage under my feet, but it was uncomfortable.

I explained that I travel every single week for business and that I know the rules but the site wasn’t working - not on mobile and not on desktop or app. They still charged me and accused me of lying. I wrote a complain and the customer service there said that it was my fault for not complying to the terms, even though they made it impossible to.

573,J Rose," Luton to Girona. First Ryanair experience, went into this expecting the worst, ended up being a good experience. First of all their app is as good as any in the industry, which helps. The additional services they upsell (too frequently) are sensible and clear, and can be decent value. The need to physically print a paper boarding pass for non EU or UK passengers is the only real headache and lacks sensibility.

For every delay we didn’t get the messages in time so we were stuck outside the gate. Then when we finally got on the plane, we were stuck on it for over an hour.

589,Antony Dixon,"  Gatwick to Alicante. This airline has got to be the worst I have ever flown with, they give you a cheap price for the ticket then get you at the airport for as much money as they can get out of you. For example cabin luggage we had to pay £40.00 for a cabin case that is accepted on every airline on the planet and the only one they will accept is no bigger than your wallet (funny that!) and soon they will probably start charging for that soon. Then if you don’t pay extra again for your seat they make sure one of you is at the front of the aeroplane and the other is at the back. I will never fly with Ryanair again because if you fly with a normal airline it works out cheaper in the end as I have checked this so save all the grief and pay the few pounds extra when you go to a normal airline and you will save money and stress.",Economy Class,n,2019-05-10,gatwick alicante airline got worst ever flown give cheap price ticket get airport much money get example cabin luggage pay cabin case accepted every airline planet one accept bigger wallet funny soon probably start charging soon pay extra seat make sure one front aeroplane back never fly ryanair fly normal airline work cheaper end checked save grief pay pound extra go normal airline save money stress,0.4588,Neutral,403

Now it was 2 hours to the flight that facility was closed and we'd have to pay 55 euros each extra. The original flight cost was only £71 each return so that was too much. A rip off. Fair enough to charge us a bit but not that much. Then we were given our seat numbers and surprise surprise we weren't seated together even though the plane was half empty. We then proceeded on the plane to all swap seats so people were sat next to each other which because of all the empty seats was no problem. I know we could have paid to sit next to each other, but again they charge too much. £2 or £3 and I like many people would pay, but not £9 each,each way. Greedy.

My flight was the next day at 3:30PM. I tried checking in online with the app and website but it kept saying that my reservation number was incorrect. I tried calling that night but their customer service was not open, so I waited until the next morning to call. I called 3 different times that day and waited on hold for costumer service for a total of 65 min and never was able to connect to anyone. Once I arrived at airport, in Bucharest, I spoke to Ryanair sales rep and her manager was treated absolutely terribly.

But when I got to the ticket counter I was informed that because I did not check in online I would be charged a 55 Euro “check in fee”. I was at the ticket counter an hour and a half before my flight, but they told me you could only check in in person 2 hours before a flight to avoid the 55 Euro fee? I’ve never heard of any other airline doing something like this. I asked if I had any other options since I had tried to check in via their app and website which had not been working. I was rudely told “Pay the fee now, or get out of line and don’t fly with us.” To top it all off, the exchange rate to US dollars made my fee increase to $61.52.

597,C Dawson,"  Dublin to Malta. I flew recently with Ryanair and normally have no complaints, play by the rules and you can get a good deal. I dont buy priority which is farcical, bring a hold all, People were bring rugsacks and putting them in the overhead bins, also dont opt for seat selection, they will rob you at 10 euro a seat to ensure you are sitting together, I opted for random allocation for me my 12 and 13 year old and look at the screen shot, a whole row free but we are dotted all around the front of the cabin. I saved myself 160 euro by not opting for priority and not selecting seats On the outbound flight, my clothes got destroyed with someone else's chewing gum that was left on a seat and I only discovered this when I was leaving airport, my jeans and coat had to be placed in the freezer and while I was able to get the gum off my jeans I couldn't retrieve my coat at all. Also there was a really drunk lady on the flight, allowed to get on the plane drunk and the staff kept serving her the whole flight. When the plane landed she was inebriated and the staff escorted her quite roughly and deposited her on the transfer bus, the lady was three sheets to the wind, they did not arrange any assistance for her and it was left to me and my husband to get her through security and try to get her to a taxi, she was staggering and shouting and could have been abusive. Why allow a drunk person on a flight? Why keep serving a drunk person who is over the limit and a risk to themselves and others? Does sales targets over-ride customer and flight safety?

599,P Foster," Together with my wife and my two kids (3 and 10) we were going to Copenhagen for a weekend trip. We booked Ryanair from Stuttgart because the offered price was attractive. I’m flying quite a lot for work and I am used to normal flight practices. However, what Ryanair is doing is just fraudulent and absolutely unacceptable. For the flight to CPH we checked in through the internet, printed our boarding passes at home and everything was ok. In Copenhagen we stayed in an apartment without access to a printer. Also, I didn’t know checkin had to be done a minimum of 2 hours in advance through the internet, as this was not mentioned at all on the Print-outs of the e-tickets. Upon arrival at the checkin area, we were informed we had to pay 60 EUR per person because our checkin was not done on time (we arrived there 1h and 50 minutes before flight time), which meant an additional Eur 240 for the 4 of us. We were not the only ones concerned and just next to me was a handicapped couple, which also needed to pay. Such kind of business practices are just unbearable and fraudulent, because this information was not mentioned anywhere. Apart from Ryanair I totally do not understand how airport staff can accept such business behaviour, because at the end it’s them who force the people to pay. These people are no Ryanair employees, in fact there is no Ryanair office, nor Ryanair employees in the whole of Scandinavia. Also in Stuttgart airport there are no Ryanair people present at all. I would feel ashamed pushing through such policies on the back of the customers and I do not understand how people can go to work every day under such circumstances, because obviously they have to deal with many unhappy and sometimes angry passengers, who just feel nailed by such business practices. Well, I learned from this experience that I will never fly Ryanair again, neither for work, nor for holidays. And for sure my two kids will never fly Ryanair again either.

605,B Griffiths," April 2019. I was traveling all around Scotland 3 weeks before my Ryanair flight. I didn't have access to a printer so I couldn't print my boarding pass. I got to the airport 15 minutes late or 1 hour and 45 minutes before my flight, only to find that they were hitting me with a 55 pound penalty. As a senior citizen, I pleaded my case with the ticket agent and she said it was policy not to waive the fee. Now keep in mind the 55 pounds was more than double the price of my ticket. So I said I'm better off just re-booking my flight and not paying the 55 pound fee. They said, ""no you can't do that the flight is booked."" However, if I pay the 50 pounds in addition to what I already paid for the ticket, they can find a seat for me. That was just terrible. They may have robbed me the 55 pounds this time, but do you think I will ever fly that airline again? No way! Not only did they lose a customer, but they lost any future business. Whoever the marketing person is who came up with that policy should be fired. It discriminates against Americans because we don't see this type of fine or penalty for not checking exactly 2 hours before a flight. I flew a different airline on the way back. It's their loss.

607,C Phillips,"  Flying to Santorini using this same airline, we had no issues. Coming home was a different experience. We paid extra for priority boarding both ways that gave us the option to have a small bag and personal item. The flight from Santorini to Athens was the problem. Because I was close to the front of the line, I watched about 20 passengers go through. They said our bags were too big. They are hard bags so they cannot expand. Mine fit in the bin but “not with room” and my husband was close to fitting in the bin. Therefor we were each charged 50€ (100€ total) for the same bags we brought. They made us pay cash because our credit cards didn’t work. I gave the woman 3 different cards, all of which had worked in the country. As I stood in line because my husband was forced to go to the ATM, I watched 1 bag goes through and one bag of same or similar size does not. The credit card machine never worked once. When my husband asked for a receipt, she said she could not give him one. We made her let us take pictures of everything as a result. She complied that much.

As I was travelling before Easter the airport was very busy and yet the staff coped admirably. Before boarding, I noted with curiosity that each person checking-in had his / her photograph taken before boarding the flight. The flight left in a punctual manner and the staff worked hard. They made an announcement about a passenger with a nut allergy and took matters very seriously. The relatively short flight was well managed. My seat was not at all comfortable alas. The price I paid was not that much cheaper than the rivals on the route.

614,Lizelle Hattingh,  Ryanair is an absolute nightmare. We have used them twice on one trip and they have different standards at every airport and every counter. We made a booking and paid for an extra bag and everything was fine at Dublin but when we got to Malaga we had to pay extra for the bag as their system did not show that we paid for a bag. What was worse is the fact that they told us at check-in that the bag might be fine and we might not jave to pay for it but if their colleague at the boarding gate feels that it is too big we might br ble to pay at the gate pr maybe they won't let us go through at all. They weren't able to give us any assurance about what would happen at the boarding gate though. It's all based on the opinion of the specific person at the time. At Dublin we also had to pay a penalty of 110 euro because we didn't have boarding passes however when we got to Malaga them system worked completely different and we didn't need to have boarding passes.

615,D Murbana,"  Stansted to Rome. Terrible experience today! Not very pleased to say this is not my first with Ryanair. So we book our flight in March for today, 20th April 2019. We checked in yesterday and paid for the selected seats (after already having acquired Priority and 2 Cabin Bags) for 2 travellers. We leave Wales at night and get to the Stansted airport more than 3h prior to departure. The flight was scheduled at 6:25. At 5:10 still nothing is showing on the screens, so I go to the toilet and then we head straight to security. As soon as we get through security we look at the screen again (around 5:40) and the screen says ""Final Call"". Being in a a rush we run through the queues and head to gate 59. When we get there we get told that it's actually gate 91 (other side of the airport) and the lady says ""there's only 2 minutes left, you won't make it"". We ask whether she can make a call to advise we are on our way and this obviously was declined. So we start running again, with backpacks and hold luggages, to get to the right gate. This was very difficult to find and the airport staff we asked weren't that helpful. As expected we don't make it on time. We make our way to the ""Returning Customers"" gates and the airport lady did not even give advise on where to go or what to do, but simply cancelled our boarding passes and wished us a ""lovely weekend"". Lovely Easter weekend: stuck in an airport and our families waiting for us overseas! Ok, so we lose the money paid (around £90) but we don't give up on spending our holidays with our relatives and friends! So we buy the next available flight from Stansted to Rome: 13:25 same day, with Ryanair. We pay the tickets, pay for the 10kg bags and do the check-in straight away. Having travelled with Ryanair for many years I knew that they are able to refund part of the original ticket price (€100 or £79), to use this money towards the cost of the new booking. This is apparently only applicable in certain circumstances, one of which is if you show up at the Ryanair desk not later than 1h after the original departure time. We get into the queue 15/20 min before the deadline and wait for about 30 min, to then be told by the two very unhelpful and disregarded agents (who had not a clue of what this process is), that we had to speak to the Money Exchange team. We leave the queue and wait to speak to this lady who, obviously, said ""I have nothing to do with flights"". Customer Service was terrible to say the least. What happened to the ""Gate Open"" and ""Boarding"" announcements on the screen? Is it a new trend to jump straight to the last call? To cause people stress, sickness, anxiety and everything else that comes with missing a flight, including massive extra financial expenses? Or is this just the way airlines operate today? Playing sick games to ensure people miss flights and spend extra money? Initially I mentioned that this was not my first misfortune with Ryanair: 3 years ago, summer time, my flight was delayed by 3 hours...my solicitors told me that my claim for refund/compensation has been placed on hold due to Ryanair having too many complaints and not dealing with them.

616,Jannik Hol,"  Munich to Palma de Mallorca. Laudamotion/Ryanair is probably one of the biggest scam airlines, I’ve ever seen. When boarding the plane, they make customers pay 20€ per carry-on bag (!) in cash (!), claiming that it was advertised in a confirmation email before (which it never was). We did not have enough cash on us and had to borrow money from some random people who were as baffled as we were by this scam move right before getting on the plane. Why don’t you make the tickets 20€ more expensive instead of fooling people into booking a ticket and then screwing them before they are about to board?

617,T Meares,"  Manchester to Barcelona. Read the fine print very carefully. I did not, and I paid dearly.  Luggage: included in the cost is what you can fit under the seat in front of you. It appears they purposefully spread your group out in the cabin. For example, I had an empty seat next to me on one of our flights, yet they didn't seat my young daughter and I together. She was in the rear of the plane and I was up front. Seating together costs extra. Technically they charge for choosing your seat, but again, my opinion is that it seems they make an effort to spread families around the plane unless you pay for the seating option. Their check-in process is a scam. You will receive an email 3 days before travel telling you to check in online or you will be charged 55 pounds. Okay, fair enough because they have warned you with a personal email, until you try to check in. After you enter all your passport and personal information for you and your party and go through all that hassle and get to the end of the check-in process, they'll tell you that you have to pay a fee to check in prior to 48 hours before departure. If you forget (like I did) and remember to do so once you arrive at the airport 1 hour and 59 minutes before your flight (like I did) and try to check in online, it will cost you 55 pounds per ticket.  Here's the process: a) Wait in the queue at check in. The check in person informs you that you owe a fee. She fills out the a form (by hand) that you have to take to customer service. Wait in the queue at customer service. Pay your fee (which for us doubled the cost of our tickets). They fill out another form by hand (including credit card information by hand) and stamp it. You have to take this new form back to check in. Wait for a second time in the check in queue. You hand her this second form and she finally issues the boarding passes. Run to security because although you arrived 1 hour and 59 minutes early, most of that time has now been spent in 3 queues just to get a boarding pass. Again, read the fine print and understand what you are in fo.

621,Stephen McCloskey,"  Liverpool to Dublin. Ryanair have carefully designed significant financial pitfalls into their customer experience. 6 months ago, they removed the ability to take any practical-sized hand luggage on board without paying extra for it. As a 'sweetener', this additional cost granted you Priority Boarding. However, Priority is the new 'Normal', because 80% of travellers actually require a usable sized bag. The other rip off is the fee if you forget to check in within 2hrs of your flight. I have used Ryanair all my life, to regularly visit family in Ireland, and go to destinations in Europe, regularly noting their desperate and greedy attempts to extort more money from their customers/captive audience for things that were previously included within the ticket price.

626,George Nugent,"  Prague to Edinburgh. This was my 5th flight with Ryanair in 7 days, and following the previous experiences with Ryanair this flight had high standards to meet. Immediately after getting off the bus from the terminal I noticed this aircraft was fitted with the old style of Ryanair cabin, this was to be expected but not to be looked forward too.  When the safety demonstration was being performed it came across that the crew simply could not be bothered with their jobs and just wanted to be at home. After takeoff the crew continued to look fed up and put no effort into providing a decent onboard service for customers. When pushing the trolley through the aircraft they seemed to show the most attention to those customers who were sat on the left hand side of the plane.

627,Mia Montecalvo,"  From start to finish everything with the process has been shocking. ‘Low fares made simple’ understatement of the century. Our flight prices were not low and nothing was at all simple. £209 + £82 then a further £40 totalling £331. Few pointers, as I’m not the only one this has happened to in the past week. When people are purchasing what they think is a cabin bag make it much more clear that it’s not. In the circumstances people have purchased a check in bag and gotten through to security with these bags still in tow actually have staff at the airport to help. I paid for bags to be on hold and had to pay again for the bags to be taken from us upon boarding and to go on hold. This second charge should have never happened somebody should have taken these cases and put them in hold like I had paid for. The flight going and coming back we’re both delayed, pure lack of organisation is the only explanation. Upon landing back in the UK being stuck on the plane as there’s no buses to take passengers to the airport. Surely this is something that should be pre organised? Crew members were rude both going and coming, rude to each other, rude to passengers, sat in the back of the plane on their phones. Hardly professional is it? When trying to get help via a live chat to have the chat ended and not be listened to. Again rude and unprofessional. I will certainly make sure to avoid using this airline at all costs, and I will certainly make sure friends and family no longer use this airline.",Economy Class,n,2019-04-11,start finish everything process shocking low fare made simple understatement century flight price low nothing simple totalling pointer one happened past week people purchasing think cabin bag make much clear circumstance people purchased check bag gotten security bag still tow actually staff airport help paid bag hold pay bag taken u upon boarding go hold second charge never happened somebody taken case put hold like paid flight going coming back delayed pure lack organisation explanation upon landing back uk stuck plane bus take passenger airport surely something pre organised crew member rude going coming rude rude passenger sat back plane phone hardly professional trying get help via live chat chat ended listened rude unprofessional certainly make sure avoid using airline cost certainly make sure friend family longer use airline,-0.3818,Negative,843
628,Carl Hyslop," Malaga to Stockholm. Had three choices at booking: regular, plus, or flex plus.

631,K Merksen,"  On April 1st we flew from Cologne to Stansted. For some reason I wasn't able to check-in online so we (party of 3) decided to check-in at the airport itself where you often have the self check-in counters. So we arrived 2,5 hours before the flight but not self check-in counter to be found. We decided to go stand in the queue for boarding where they can print our boarding passes. They explained that we had to go to customer service first. Arriving at customer service they told us that we had to pay €55 per person for them to check us in. I told them that's ridiculous since I tried several times at home and when that didn't work we tried to do it at the airport. Now she is telling us we have to pay an additional €165! So I said never mind I'll try to check in by ourselves again whereas she responds that it isn't possible anymore because it had to be 2 hours before and we already passed that so we had to pay. That really started our vacation on a bad note. On the return it was just as bad. Thankfully I did manage to check-in this time but we had priority check-in yet they just let everybody through the gate already. When we came downstairs to walk up to the plane we had to wait for almost 30 minutes, mind you, I was not able to go anywhere besides standing there and while being pregnant! Very annoying. Once we finally got on the flight the two stewardesses were very unprofessional!

It did not work, and told me instead to check in at the counter prior to 40 minutes before my flight. I was there and talked to the ticket agent, but she told me that I would have to go pay €55 to check in and get my boarding pass. That was not shown anywhere on the emails I received or sign-up page, and is clearly a scam to make more money. The representative also said there was not enough time to even check in although I had followed the instructions, and so I missed my flight.

637,M Wartel,"  I booked a return flight from Berlin Schönefeld to Riga through Ryanair. After receiving my check-in reminder, I tried to check in online, but it wouldn’t allow me to select any of the buttons to proceed with the chek-in due to a technical error, so I tried again later that evening, but it was doing the same thing. I then tried checking in 3 times Tuesday the 9th, but it was still not working. The last time I tried was Wednesday morning 2 hours before my flight, but the site was still faulty so I went to the airport to check-in in person. The Ryanair service desk charged me an additional 60 Euro for late check-in.  He said that he checked and that there was nothing wrong with the website. This was not true as I called their call center, and they confirmed that they had problems with their website as well as the app over those  days.  When I arrived in Riga, I saw on Facebook that other people was also complaining about the website not working properly during those exact days. I took screenshots of this as proof. We called Ryanair customer service on the Wednesday and one of the sales consultants confirmed that she is aware of the technical problems Ryanair was experiencing on those days. She said I should get the 60 Euro back without any problems. I wrote to Ryanair asking to refund me the 60. euros, but they replied saying that it is my responsibility to contact them in case their website is down, thus they refuse to refund me. I find this dishonest as a company shouldn't benefit fat the expense of a passenger from their own website being down. To add further insult to injury, the cabin crew insisted on measuring my hand luggage 3 times in between walking through check-in and getting onto the plane.

Totally disappointing experience, Ryanair has a questionable policy regarding the suitcases, I had to make a first payment for shipping a small suitcase weighing less than 10 kilos, when embarking I had to pay €20 extra for not having checked the suitcase, finally the cost of the flight is more expensive for this reason, there was another extra cost to be able to choose a seat as the seat allocation system assigns you separate seats from your family members so that you have to pay an extra to travel together.

We had two pieces of hand luggage and were on seats 1A and 1B which was great. Miles of legroom and no-one besides us. Plane departed on time but had to make a detour because of a strike in Belgium. Therefore flight took a little over 4 hours but not the airline's fault. Nice crew which made two rounds with reasonably priced food and drinks. Inbound flight equal: on time and comfortable because of seats at the emergency seat, which is well worth the euros on a 3,5 hrs long flight.

657,Dariusz Wiatrak," Kraków to Madrid via Berlin. In the recent months Ryanair shifted from OK to terrible. It is no longer airline for normal travellers. Service is terrible on every level and with all additional charges for even a small luggage, seat selection, insurance etc this airline became high price. If you add the poor service on every level: ticket purchase, luggage acceptance etc this airline is most likely on their way down. It is obvious that with all extra charges even for a 10kg luggage (25€ - what passanger flies with a lap top bag only) the true ticket price is hidden and this is a price cheating. On the top many of their flights due to charging for a luggage at the gate, are late. Therefore if you book a flight with Ryanair be careful since your ticket price can easily double with their extra charges. For the business people the ward of advise regarding Ryanair - do never use them. If someone aske for a value for money what Ryanair offers I am quick to say 1 of 10 where 1 being terrible. A ward of caution for the Ryanair management, there were several airline trying to squeeze every penny from their passangera/clients in the past and it was good to see they became airline from the past.",Economy Class,n,2019-02-19,krak w madrid via berlin recent month ryanair shifted ok terrible longer airline normal traveller service terrible every level additional charge even small luggage seat selection insurance etc airline became high price add poor service every level ticket purchase luggage acceptance etc airline likely way obvious extra charge even kg luggage passanger fly lap top bag true ticket price hidden price cheating top many flight due charging luggage gate late therefore book flight ryanair careful since ticket price easily double extra charge business people ward advise regarding ryanair never use someone aske value money ryanair offer quick say terrible ward caution ryanair management several airline trying squeeze every penny passangera client past good see became airline past,0.2263,Neutral,780

663,H Benson,"  Palermo to Milan. Terrible experience. One staff member at the Palermo airport in particular was incredibly rude and out of line. As soon as we got to the check in counter we were scolded by the Ryanair employee for not printing out our boarding pass (something we didn’t know as this was our first time flying Ryanair). We were instantly met with a disrespectful attitude that was unprompted. We were sent to a different counter to print the boarding passes for 44 euro. Coming back to the check in counter we were met with more scolding for having bags that exceeded the weight limit. The employee was basically appalled that we had extra weight and again sent us to the other counter to pay for being overweight (205 extra euros!). We already knew before coming to the airport that we were going to have to pay a fee for the extra weight so again we were met with unprompted disrespect; we even told this employee that we understood we had to pay more and we’re okay with that but again his reaction was demeaning and unwarranted. We did not talk back nor initiate any disrespectful dialogue and hence why I am prompted to write this review. We barely made our flight because we were setback with these additional waits which I believe all the services should be done at one counter. This whole experience put a really bad taste in my mouth with this airline. I never got the name of the person who was so rude to us because we were so frantic to get our boarding passes and paying for extra weight. I am displeased with the customer service presented. This person needs to learn how to be respectful and accommodating rather than scolding at a stressful environment to begin with.

664,R Hensen,"  Stansted to Rabat. When booking our flights, we made two errors: 1. we booked through kiwi.com, which meant Ryanair really couldn't help much. A mistake was made in entering my first name; in other words, my husband listed his first name for both passengers: Mr. S _____ and Ms S ______. When we noticed the error, we first tried finding a solution through a Live Chat with Ryanair. They kept asking for the email address with which the flight was booked. It turns out that since we booked through a third party, kiwi.com used their own email address. When we contacted them, they informed us they couldn't give out that email address. When I tried to manage my booking to change the name, they wanted to charge 382 Euros--a ridiculous price set by the airline (and the cost of 2 new tickets). And it turns out that no one could do anything for us. When we tried to cancel the flight, not only were we unable to recoup even the cost of the prepaid luggage fees, but kiwi.com would charge a 20 Euro cancellation fee. So we simply didn't show up for the flight and made other arrangements to get to Spain from Rabat!

683,T Nance," I was flying from Thessaloniki to Bologna. The weather was terrible (heavy snowstorm) and a lot of flights were either cancelled or rerouted. However what happened with Ryanair was unprecedented. Although all passengers from other airline companies were brought to their hotels by around 2.30 in the morning, passengers from 3 Ryanair flights were moved out of the airport at around 7.00 in the morning. In the beginning, the company did not officially cancel the flights so we were not allowed to take our luggage. Afterwards, we were not properly informed whether we should change our tickets (Ryanair was not going to send an aircraft the next day, so passengers would have to wait 2 or 3 days at least to fly to their destinations). ask for a refund or wait to catch a flight the next day. In addition, the online application did not work, so we had to form endless queues for any option we wanted to follow. In general, the situation was chaotic. The company is totally disorganised and left 3 or 4 employees (for whom there is absolutely no complaint, they were trying to do their best) to deal with more than 400-500 passengers (from 3 flights) without having the proper instructions from their headquarters. During the whole night that we stayed in the airport, I was under the impression that the company policy was to make us book our own hotels and therefore save the company some cash. In that respect, Ryanair vouchers are half the price compared to the other companies and they are being announced in a -kind of- secret way!!! The next day the weather was sunny so Ryanair started accommodating the flights of that day, so that the company would not have to deal with more delays, refunds etc. This resulted in the passengers of the already delayed flights being stranded at the airport for 2-3 days without any information (their flights were not even shown in the ""departures"" table). The situation was ""resolved"" when incredibly angry customers demanded to catch the next Ryanair aircraft available. After a lot of fights with the personnel and the person in charge of the airline (police presence was deemed necessary) I believe we finally boarded a plane with a different original destination. Flight was acceptable, although Ryanair did not even consider offering a bottle of water to the passengers. Do yourselves a favour, give some extra money and travel with a different company. No matter what the weather conditions are, you will at least be treated with respect, like normal human beings (again I am talking about the policy of the company, not the personnel in particular).",Economy Class,n,2019-01-08,flying thessaloniki bologna weather terrible heavy snowstorm lot flight either cancelled rerouted however happened ryanair unprecedented although passenger airline company brought hotel around morning passenger ryanair flight moved airport around morning beginning company officially cancel flight allowed take luggage afterwards properly informed whether change ticket ryanair going send aircraft next day passenger would wait day least fly destination ask refund wait catch flight next day addition online application work form endless queue option wanted follow general situation chaotic company totally disorganised left employee absolutely complaint trying best deal passenger flight without proper instruction headquarters whole night stayed airport impression company policy make u book hotel therefore save company cash respect ryanair voucher half price compared company announced kind secret way next day weather sunny ryanair started accommodating flight day company would deal delay refund etc resulted passenger already delayed flight stranded airport day without information flight even shown departure table situation resolved incredibly angry customer demanded catch next ryanair aircraft available lot fight personnel person charge airline police presence deemed necessary believe finally boarded plane different original destination flight acceptable although ryanair even consider offering bottle water passenger favour give extra money travel different company matter weather condition least treated respect like normal human being talking policy company personnel particular,0.856,Positive,1595

687,D Neale,"  Frankfurt to Krakow. Ryanair tries to rip-off their customers with their new & confusing baggage allowance policies. They wanted to charge us twice for the exact same piece of luggage (regular carry-on luggage), just ridiculous. We bought two regular Ryanair tickets approx. 3 weeks prior departure for 225€ (round-trip) per ticket on the Ryanair website. When I tried to check-in online, I realized you have to pay for luggage larger than a laptop case. We decided to check-in at the airport in FRA and asked at the counter whether our Ryanair ticket for 225€ really does not include a regular carry-on sized piece of luggage? They told us no and we had to pay 10€ per carry-on luggage/way extra, which means that we paid 40€ for our small, only luggage for the out- & inbound flight additionally. Consequently, our ticket FRA-KRK-FRA added up to a total of 245€ pp. Definitely not a low cost price, but unfortunately, we had no other option. We paid the additional costs without big discussions and received an invoice, clearly stating our names and the amount of 40€ in total for the in- and outbound flight for two. When we were flying back to FRA from KRK, they wanted to charge us again for the exact same carry-on luggage we have already paid for despite showing them the invoice. The Ryanair staff behaved unreasonably and did not even show a bit of understanding (even other people passing by were saying that the baggage regulations are really confusing) and were just threatening us to either pay or stay in KRK! I was showing them my invoice and saying that I am not gonna pay one more additional penny and they instantly said that we would have to stay. I was freaking out in front of all passengers and it took 5 more minutes of discussions, threats and shouting until they finally let us go without paying.

689,Jamal Hossain,  Luton to Marrakesh. Myself and my family booked flights to Marrakesh to have our Christmas holiday abroad. Our flights we're on 20 Dec 2018 and returning on the 27 Dec 2018. We booked and paid in full 5 months in advance (July 2018) going with Ryanair but returning with easyJet. I had to pay extra for priority cabin luggage as they made the cabin bags optional. When I booked my outbound flights in advance my flight time was 15:05 and reaching my destination time was 18:40 but a month before my travel I have received a email from Ryanair air stating my flights time was changed to 16:30 departure from Luton. I couldn't find a number to contact Ryanair so there was online Ryanair customers service agent chat. I chat various people stating if my flight can be put to earlier flight and nobody was able to help me. I asked if there was any compensation for changing the flights but as soon as I mention the word compensation my chat ends (goes off line).

692,C Cole," They are constantly changing rules, even the staff don’t understand the new policies anymore. We booked a flight in August and the policy about the hand luggage changed in November. We were not able to change our ticket to priority (because that is what you need to do if you want to take your hand luggage with you in the aircraft) so we added the luggage during check-in. This costs us 10 pounds. At the gate we were informed that we had to drop our luggage at the check-in desk (which was not clear at all) so we had to pay an additional 10 pounds to take our luggage in the aircraft. Once in the aircraft we were told that we cannot take our luggage in the aircraft. After explaining everything to 3 different people, they finally let us go and we were able to take our luggage with us. Really Ryanair, just make sure you get your staff trained and don’t change your rules and policies all the time. They will definitly lose a lot of customers.

693,Francesco Corte,"  
Copenhagen to Bologna. Ryanair has gone too far. Constantly changing rules to earn few extra euros - unprepared staff, loud ads running during the flight, flight attendants turned to bazaar vendors selling all sorts of unnecessary items (who buy those by the way?), no frequent flyer program, no waiting lounge, no free customer service number. And now that ridiculous new rule on baggage is confusing, unfair and so time wasting. I can’t really see the business sense of all that either. I take Ryanair when it goes where the other airlines don’t go, not because of the cheap tickets. Charge me what is right for my ticket but leave in my peace before and during the flight.

694,P Keane,"  Stansted to Shannon. So you pay for priority boarding? You're wasting your money. The queue for priority boarding was 100 people long when I joined the queue and even longer behind me after 30 minutes. The non - priority queue? 4 people when I joined the queue and about 20 or so when boarding started. So you pay for priority to carry your case on board? Don't bother - the non priority queue had cases just like mine. But the non priority queue on the other side of the barrier will board after the priority queue? Are you kidding? the non priority queue got on the same bus at the same time as the priority queue and a lot quicker as well as there were so few of them. Nobody supervised the gate - the automatic door opened and we all got onto the bus together. The gate number was 90. On board, it was fine - I had a window seat on both journeys (despite not paying for a seat reservation) and was happy counting the revenue stream as the bags were loaded into the aircraft hold. I counted several thousand pounds worth of revenue for Ryanair on the assumption that the bags were priced at £25 each. Ryanair are very clever in convincing the flying public to pay for priority when there is no priority - and even more clever in marketing the product so that the majority of your passengers actually take the option. I suggest that as the public catch on to this cunning revenue maximising plan you will have to change the rules again as ""priority"" boarding is probably breaking some trade description act and the public aren't stupid. However, despite this little rant, don't forget that Ryanair does offer exceptionally low prices and if it wasn't for them and other similar low cost carriers we'd still be paying extortionate prices to the likes of BA and Aer Lingus and moaning about their high fares and poor service levels.

700,Joaquim Mateus,"  Made two trips recently with Ryanair and on those two trips we left late (almost one hour). Boarding is slow. With their new policy of paying for the once free cabin luggage everyone has priority so its really just more of the same under a different name - this is my experience of observing their boarding process. Staff could be more friendly but that's not a major issue. They're polite and know what they're doing. Food looks expensive but smells good - so far I've only tried coffee so can't say much about it. The seat space is appalling. Also they really seem to split people that travel together when you select random seat allocation - I understand its random but seems quite unnecessary and makes it look like Ryanair only really cares about your money.

Unfortunately Ryanair did not pass my payment to the shuttle provider Viajes Russadir. This week it starts and will have to book another transfer and pay. I can advise everyone to book special services with Ryanair. Ryanair is pulling its own customers over the table. The ""Support / Service"" is the worst I have ever experienced. After about 30 emails I got the same answer that they can do nothing and I should contact the shuttle provider. What should they do? They did not receive the payment, that means no transfer. The last 10 reactions from Ryanair were then copy & paste: the position would remain the same and that the matter is now clarified. I visited the Facebook and read the running volume, that the support is bad or there is no compensation. So you can be lucky if everything runs smoothly or bad luck. In future I will not book any special services by an Airline. You have no trouble if the payment is not forwarded by the airline.

709,Charlie Bondhus,"  Edinburgh to Brindisi via Stansted. You can't pay for your baggage at the baggage check in. I arrived at the airport 2 hours in advance of my domestic flight from Edinburgh to London. I proceeded through the queue to check my baggage at the automated kiosk. I weighed my bag and received an error message. The attendant told me that I needed to go to the Ryanair check-in desk to check my bag. I did so, and the Ryanair attendant at the desk said she could not take my payment. She said I needed to go to the other end of the terminal to the Swissport Desk. I was already starting to worry about making it to the gate on time, but I didn’t have any choice but to follow the attendant’s orders. So I crossed the terminal and waited in queue at the Swissport Desk for 40 minutes with several other people who were in the same situation. Everybody looked angry and worried because there was only one agent handling customers, and she was moving very slowly. When I finally got my turn, it was too late. The gate had closed. When I told this to the slow attendant, she was exceedingly rude, remarking that I should have ""spoken up"" from the queue if I had an imminent flight. The problem was, every single person in the queue was in the same position that I was. Ryanair wasn’t letting anybody pay for their baggage at the baggage desk! Was I supposed to cut in line? Leaving on a later flight would've caused me to miss my connection in London, so I had to pay 70 pounds to take a train from Edinburgh to London so I could make the connection in time. Ryanair has repeatedly refused to refund me for the Edinburgh-London part of the trip even though their attendants were at fault. Adding insult to injury, they keep sending me form letters which pointedly ignore the substance of my complaint. Essentially, they blame me for not taking ""a long security queue"" into account.

Further, in this case, my two bags had to be physically processed at the counter anyway. Wanderio acknowledged that ""the details that we shared in the confirmation e-mail might have not been clear enough regarding this issue"". To add injury to insult, it also informed me that the extra charge over the price of the tickets was not $60 as at the airport, but 79 Euros or about $85!.

Unfortunately due to the very bad weather, the pilot has decided to land in Verona instead of Bergamo for safety reasons. My flight from Bergamo to London would be departed in 1 hour They have organized the transfer to Bergamo by buses (almost 2 hours) and when we arrived finally to Bergamo, my flight had already left. I went to the Ryanair's ticket office to ask to get the first flight to London Stansted. There I found the worst service ever seen: no customer service, no support, no understanding, crazy queue, only 2 desks and they called you by numbers. It Was a nightmare after a long day. When finally was my turn and together with passengers with my same issue, we have asked to get the first flight to London because was not our fault to have missed the flight. They replied to us that they would have inserted us in a waiting list and they have asked to charge 100 euros each passenger to get the first flight available that maybe would be departed even the day after. All of that without hotel, even a bottle of water. This is absolutely shameful! I really needed to be in London asap and I have decided to pay the fee and fortunately I got the next flight to London. Of course I am trying to get the refund with our solicitors and I will ask even the apologies from them. PS: The lady that works at the Ryanair point in Naples airport (Monday Morning 29th of October) should be fired and she need a very long training.

722,Elena Atomei," Flew Palermo to Bucharest. I do not recommend Ryanair to anyone and I strongly suggest to avoid this horrible company. They lost my baggage during a flight, I called daily to the airport, I talked daily to the Ryanair customer service which, obviously, could not help, and in the end I can say that I did everything I could to get it back or to get a refund, but nobody cared at all. The information they give is not clear, the time they put me to wait was between 7 and 21 days and even like this nothing changed. Everybody is sorry, but nobody does anything.

723,Roy Carpenter," Flew Faro to Bristol with Ryanair. The usual efficient but basic experience with flights on time and friendly helpful crew. I fly with 'special assistance' and they are always very good in helping me and assisting with luggage. On the outbound flight weather conditions were very poor - as a retired pilot I estimated ground visibility height at about 200' - and I anticipated a diversion to Cardiff, but the Captain made an excellent landing on a wet and windy runway. We later found out that several other flights had indeed been diverted. The return flight had an unusual incident - because the forward toilet was inoperative, the seat belt signs were switched on in calm conditions to clear a way to the rear toilets for the crafty Captain and First Officer in turn!",Economy Class,y,2018-11-02,flew faro bristol ryanair usual efficient basic experience flight time friendly helpful crew fly special assistance always good helping assisting luggage outbound flight weather condition poor retired pilot estimated ground visibility height anticipated diversion cardiff captain made excellent landing wet windy runway later found several flight indeed diverted return flight unusual incident forward toilet inoperative seat belt sign switched calm condition clear way rear toilet crafty captain first officer turn,0.9643,Positive,515
724,E Saunders," Flew Ryanair from Cologne to Bristol. I fly this journey every couple of months and I cannot remember the last time the flight wasn't delayed at least an hour. If it's going to be a later time just make it a later time! Now we have to pay for 'extras' which any decent airline would not charge for, such as carry on luggage or sitting next to loved ones. So they can say the flight is cheap but by the time you've added on the things you need it isn't cheap anymore. Shameful money grabbing.

It turned out to be a very relaxed journey: two very punctual flights, with a friendly crew and very comfortable seating at the emergency exit both ways. Good info from the cockpit and I like the efficient boarding.The down side is the risk of strike. A month before we went, there was a big strike across Europe and it won't be the last.

726,C Barton,  Luton to Knock. I had not used the airport in several years and was keen to see how convenient it might be for future travel plans. I arrived early and was the first person to check-in for the flight. The check-in agent was unfriendly and did not respond to simple pleasantries. Security at this airport was not pleasant at all and I was stopped and asked to walk through a body scanning machine. Boarding was not at all well organised and one had to stand for almost 20 mins in a holding-pen area divided between priority and non-priority passengers. This was not fair on the elderly and inform. Far too much hand luggage was allowed on board. The cabin crew were not friendly nor proactive and their spoken English was poor. I overheard the lady siting directly in front of me ask for a non-meat croissant. She made this very clear. She paid her money and then had to call the flight attendant back as she was sold a meat filled croissant. The member of staff was very rude to the point of hostility. The captain gave minimal information about the flight. The landing was smooth and disembarkation orderly. ,Economy Class,y,2018-10-30,luton knock used airport several year keen see convenient might future travel plan arrived early first person check flight check agent unfriendly respond simple pleasantry security airport pleasant stopped asked walk body scanning machine boarding well organised one stand almost min holding pen area divided priority non priority passenger fair elderly inform far much hand luggage allowed board cabin crew friendly proactive spoken english poor overheard lady siting directly front ask non meat croissant made clear paid money call flight attendant back sold meat filled croissant member staff rude point hostility captain gave minimal information flight landing smooth disembarkation orderly,0.9081,Positive,694

730,Zafrullah Hamzah,"  Copenhagen to Dublin. Flight was delayed by about an hour but we knew this when we got to the Airport. I had checked in online before my outbound flight from Dublin so there was no hassle. A bit of a delay at Copenhagen Airport on the inbound flight as we were expected to print the luggage tag ourselves. A few staff floating about only to direct us to the kiosks but no help offered. It was another passenger who kindly showed me and I then assisted my colleague. Then the scan did not work when I tried to drop the bagage at the unmanned counter, only later on a staff member came to assist. A long walk to the boarding gate but I liked that as I felt that it was helping me to burn some calories, however this may not be welcomed by everyone (certainly if you can't walk long distances it may be necessary to request assistance). Service on board was slower than usual but cabin crew friendly and courteous. Ryanair has a good sélection of buy on board food and I had the fruitcake which was simply delicious and a lovely tea.

Very cheap ticket (15€), although someone needs to be careful, as this airline attempts to add a lot of costs to the client - one needs to keep that in mind when purchasing a fare. Staff was friendly and smiling. Only thing I can fault the airline was that they kept the sign to have the belt on, for the whole duration of this short flight (40'), which was uncomfortable.

746,P Tarpon ,"  Rome to Barcelona. I flew a round trip with Ryanair recently in September 2018. The first trip was not very good, it was Rome to Barcelona taking off at midnight. The flight was delayed 1.5 hours and by the time I got there public transportation was finished and I had to pay for a taxi to my hotel. Also all throughout the flight, the most annoying part were the flight attendants. Nobody else was talking except for them, chatting with each other the entire time about their boyfriends. Very unprofessional. The second time coming back was actually very good. The flight was schedule to depart at 6:30am and it boarded and left and arrived exactly on time. The flight attendants were fine and professional. I guess the key is to choose the first Ryanair flight that leaves first thing in the morning. That way their airplanes are already on the ground and finished their maintenance checks. Their schedules are so packed that if one flight gets delayed during the day, it creates a domino effect that delays every subsequent flight. In conclusion, pretty good value. I had an overall okay experience. Just remember that they will probably be delayed and to make sure that you compensate for this delay for your arrival destination. Make sure you know how to get to your hotel cheaply if it gets super delayed. I would fly again.

749,Roy Carpenter," Flight was 25 minutes delayed take-off but kept informed by Captain and made up time to land only 5 minutes late on new (February 2018) aircraft with seats comfortable for the 3 hour trip. I had special assistance which worked well (as always at Faro) and on entering mentioned to the cabin assistant that, following illness, it was our first holiday for 2 years and could we have some 'bubbly' to celebrate - immediately the seat belt sign was switched off 2 bottles of Prosecco were handed to us - a nice touch!

We also appreciate the availability of cheaper tickets (not always and not that cheap in a lot of cases!!). However, it is a bit much when corporate greed consistently comes up with ridiculous ideas on how to charge more money. Case in point: seat selection! I am not asking for a seat of my choice - however, we are a family of four (two kids included) - is it too much to ask to have seats together as a family rather than being asked to pay extra for it?

753,D Healey,"  Corfu to Stansted. I feel Ryanair has lost it's appeal over the past year or so. On this recent return trip to Corfu, flights are generally delayed to some extent. Previously we always found Ryanair to be very efficient in terms of keeping to departure times. However, boarding process and splitting people up has caused chaos on board. I can understand the theory behind thir policy, and personally, for an extra couple of € I would reserve seat together. But a lot of people still take pot luck, get seats allocated apart and then try throughout the boarding process, taxi, after take off to persuade others to change seats in order that they can sit together. Middle seats being allocated in premium seating (extra leg room, front seats that others pay €15 for). Their boarding process needs to be more streamlined as well, example, boarding at Corfu for Priority, no signs etc. to indicate where to queue. Got through gate, only to be held outside, busses arrived, but for some reason we were not allowed on them for 10 minutes, then a free for all with non-priority and priority getting on buses together. In reality, if another airline is similar in price I would chose them now over Ryanair as the whole travel process has become more chaotic, which is a shame, as with a few improvements and a bit better organisation not costing any money, it could be a far better experience.",Economy Class,n,2018-09-20,corfu stansted feel ryanair lost appeal past year recent return trip corfu flight generally delayed extent previously always found ryanair efficient term keeping departure time however boarding process splitting people caused chaos board understand theory behind thir policy personally extra couple would reserve seat together lot people still take pot luck get seat allocated apart try throughout boarding process taxi take persuade others change seat order sit together middle seat allocated premium seating extra leg room front seat others pay boarding process need streamlined well example boarding corfu priority sign etc indicate queue got gate held outside bus arrived reason allowed minute free non priority priority getting bus together reality another airline similar price would chose ryanair whole travel process become chaotic shame improvement bit better organisation costing money could far better experience,0.6597,Positive,923

755,R Dean,  Malaga to Dublin. While I understand that Ryanair is a low cost airline I find their tactics for squeezing extra money out of you distasteful. Everything is extra. For example if you would like to sit with your partner you need to pay for that privilege otherwise you'll be seated randomly. At the airport you will be treated like cattle. We were boarded for our flight and then left standing on a ramp in Malaga airport for 30 minutes while they cleaned the aircraft. The seats are uncomfortable and the service is lacking. The fact that half of their employees are currently striking for better conditions shows how badly they are treated. This translates into employees who really don't care what happens.

767,R Chasana,"  Santiago de Compostela to Barcelona. This flight was cancelled, only alternative given to us was to fly 4 days later on the first flight from the company with the same route and with seats. As this was not an option, we asked for refund and bought flights for the next days with other company. Of course the price of these flights were astronomical but we had no alternative as we could not stay four days without flying back home. We put a claim on their site to ask for compensation for cancellation and the refund of the difference between their flight and the new flight we had bought. The answer is: not reimbursing the new flight as we opted for reimbursement of our tickets, and no compensation since the flight was 'cancelled unexpectedly'. This must be the most ridiculous motive to not compensate for cancellation. Other than that: Ground service obviously did not do their job as they did not offer an alternative route (except four days later) and should have offered a place to stay for the night (it was 23.30 when we left the airport). Value for money in this case is terrible: we were refund but somehow lost 10€ between paid and refund, had to buy new tickets from our own pocket at expensive rate.

Ryanair is a bus service getting us from A to B. But, where on a Bus or Train the staff have an understanding of the English language this does not seem to apply to Ryanair cabin crew. Why oh why does Ryanair use staff on a flight to and in Great Britan who cannot speak or fully understand English. As to Ryanair staff at Stansted Airport, I attempted to talk to at the Ryanair desk, very unfriendly and uninterested, looking more through you as at you.

But I must admit, this is the only thing I didn't like about Ryanair. The crew was amazing. Food was great. Hot and fresh. A bit expensive, but fresh. Seat was, for this short kind of a flight, good. A thing that dissapointed me a bit is the fact that there isn't any storage in the seat in front of you, so I had to hold the menü for the whole flight. We flew FR9027, a 2:00 h flight.

770,David Nash,"  Aside from the poor value for money once all the additional extras like hand luggage had been taken into account, the whole experience with Ryanair (our first and last) was pretty poor. Despite there only being one scheduled flight that day between Stansted and Kefalonia, we were delayed both ways. Outbound by 2.5 hours and 2 hours coming home! Outbound flight: Kept waiting between the gate and the aircraft for 45 minutes in the heat No running water on the aircraft itself! No offer or concession for the above, then ignored by the cabin crew when they eventually served some refreshments, only to be told that we must have somehow missed the member of staff who was serving. I pointed out that she had gone straight past our section of the plane and hadn't asked anyone including ourselves if we actually wanted anything to drink. They even argued the fact that this had happened, which was quite unbelievable. But clearly they had understocked the refreshments and had decided to miss the rear section of the plane to try and account for this. Shocking lack of politeness and customer service.

Cheap flights bonus, pay more for selected seat to sit near family ok however easyJet will try to get you close anyway, more to get on priority understandable, £45 fee if your app doesn't work and you don't have a paper copy of your boarding pass. Flight itself chaotic. No one takes bags at the gate that are meant to go in hold for free resulting in everyone trying to get cabin bags on then moaning when there is no space. They pack you in, close the doors then tell you there's a delay, passengers sat making phone calls, messaging, texting at every possible opportunity throughout the flight but that's ok. They keep every possible bright light on during the entire flight (we flew overnight) so no chance of sleeping in their slimline chairs that even I struggled to get my legs comfy in and I'm only 5'6"". Then they decide to put seat belt signs on, for no apparent reason before turning them back off and bringing the trolleys out. So no one can actually go to the loo because of the trolleys and the 2 staff taking up the entire aisle! Seriously, would it not be easier to do this with the belt lights on? Return flight meant to take off at 22.30 so all lined up with gates open at 2200, but with no warning, no information given were left standing around to board just after 2240. Queues chaotic, people in priority that shouldn't be but let on anyway so everyone else left with backs and legs aching, kids crying and tired because the staff don't seem to know what they are doing.

By the way, if Ryanair payed his staff fair, we would experience more kind personnel. Later I looked at the following flights of this aircraft using the registration prefixes: EI-DLW.

783,Andrew Coogans," Berlin to Glasgow. New Boeing 737-800 with the updated ""Sky"" interior, larger overhead bins and thinner seats, which I find more comfortable than the older ones, with a little bit more legroom. Schoenefeld Airport was quieter than I had seen it, but the usual crush at the inadequately-designed followed, although boarding staff kept good control of the boarding process. Aircraft arrived early, but I could see through the window that offloading from the previous flight was taking a long time, with only one person wearing a ""Swissport Duty Station Manager"" hi viz vest directing the passengers on his own until more staff turned up and put in rear stairs and started offloading luggage. This caused a delay on departure, and the Captain apologised for the heat in the cabin, which was caused by a ""lack of air conditioning power units"" at the airport, but I could see when we were departing the aircraft needed an air start unit, so obviously there was an issue with the aircraft's ground power. This resulted in a total delay of around 30 minutes, but at least the cabin cooled down during taxi to the runway. The crew were friendly, they did their jobs efficiently and although they were a mix of nationalities, the tannoy announcements in English were very clear by the 3 different crew members who made them (something that admittedly is not always the case on Ryanair flights). Two rounds of drinks and refreshments were served and one duty free trolley run performed with an announcement about special offers etc. No inflight magazines were given out on this flight, which I don't mind as I was not planning to buy anything, but may have stopped other people from purchasing items. We landed 15 minutes late in Glasgow and rear stairs were positioned quickly on the aircraft for quick disembarking. With the exception of the unpleasant airport in Berlin this was a quick and comfortable flight. Value for money not as good as it is in the winter, but I understand that August is peak season.

784,G Sharma," Traveling with Ryanair has been an absolute nightmare. In a nutshell: I was travelling from Budapest to London Stansted. The flight had more than 2 hours delay when leaving Budapest. When we arrived in London at late night we had to wait almost 30 minutes to get out of the plane, since no bus was available to pick us up. After other 30 minutes queuing at passport control, we had to wait almost one hour for the luggage before we were informed that it could take few hours to be delivered, since there were no worker available (apparently they were on holidays or on strike). There were many passengers from other flights in the same condition. There was only a Ryanair representative, clearly overwhelmed and unable to deal with the situation. He finally provided us with a number to call the day after to have more information about our luggage. He did not tell us to file any report nor he provided us with any written information. When I left the airport it was 3am and no trace of my bag. The day after I tried to call that number maybe 20-30 times and none never picked up the phone. I had several chats with Ryanair representatives on the Ryanair website and I was just told to call the same number which doesn’t work or where nobody picks up the calls. I was told further by Ryanair representatives on the chat that when I call that number they will be able to fill with me a missing luggage report, because without it nobody can do anything. As I said before, the Ryanair representative at the airport did not mention that we had to file such a report, but he just provided us with the mentioned number to call. I have also filed several reports and complaints via Ryanair website by using different forms, nobody came back to me with any response. If I wanted to file a query with Ryanair Baggage Claim Form, I could not do it, without the missing luggage report number. Ryanair didn’t provide any different number where I could speak to someone who could effectively provide for help. I was finally advised to go to the airport to look for my luggage personally, since they could not do anything to help me. When I asked if I was going to be reimbursed for the travel expenses and for the time spent to go the airport, Ryanair representatives said that it was unlikely. Today still no trace of my luggage, I have received no answer to my emails and complaints, and the famous number is still not working. I will clearly avoid Ryanair in the future and I would suggest anyone to do the same.",Economy Class,n,2018-08-08,traveling ryanair absolute nightmare nutshell travelling budapest london stansted flight hour delay leaving budapest arrived london late night wait almost minute get plane since bus available pick u minute queuing passport control wait almost one hour luggage informed could take hour delivered since worker available apparently holiday strike many passenger flight condition ryanair representative clearly overwhelmed unable deal situation finally provided u number call day information luggage tell u file report provided u written information left airport trace bag day tried call number maybe time none never picked phone several chat ryanair representative ryanair website told call number work nobody pick call told ryanair representative chat call number able fill missing luggage report without nobody anything said ryanair representative airport mention file report provided u mentioned number call also filed several report complaint via ryanair website using different form nobody came back response wanted file query ryanair baggage claim form could without missing luggage report number ryanair provide different number could speak someone could effectively provide help finally advised go airport look luggage personally since could anything help asked going reimbursed travel expense time spent go airport ryanair representative said unlikely today still trace luggage received answer email complaint famous number still working clearly avoid ryanair future would suggest anyone,0.8831,Positive,1493
785,Michal Mokran," My experience wasn't horrible as everyone says. I've not had a single issue. On my flight from BTS to STN at 6:30 in the morning everything was excellent with the airline. It was on time, staff were nice and friendly. The only issue I've had during the boarding process was because of Bratislava airport staff but that has nothing to do with Ryanair. I have one complaint but I do understand it. Checking in we got our seats seperated, but with the ticket price Ryanair sells, it's still cheap even after buying Selected seats. The food on board was cold, but when I asked the crew to heat it some more they kindly offered to do so. After landing the process was quick, but due to some issues at Stansted (which I learned happens often) we waited over an hour for our luggage. Having arrived soon in the morning and not having had any coach/train reservation for a specific time, this wasn't an issue for me. On my way back I would have things to complain about, but I'm not sure how much of it is Ryanair's fault. The airport was crowded, we waited a long time to depart or even board, apparently because checked in luggage hadn't arrived to the plane yet. We had out gate announced on time and having a 1 hour delay isn't too bad considering it's an evening flight by a budget company. The crew were again nice even though they had a whole day of work behind them. I wouldn't complain about the seats and comfort. Of course it wasn't perfect, but it wasn't uncomfortable and I would definitely fly Ryanair again.

Completely abandoned and they won't let us out of the airport without first taking a refund for the flight, which doesn't help me as if need to pay more to fly another day or with another line.

788,D Lawden,"  Bucharest to Stansted. I'm only giving 1 star as 0 star isn't an option. They are by far the worst company I have ever had to deal with, light years behind any other organisation in terms of good customer relations. If everything goes smoothly you may get a bargain flight but when things go wrong, (12 hour delay) they go catastrophically wrong. Ryanair have zero customer support at the airport or via the phone. They leave their passengers without food or explanation of the cause of the delay. They admit fault after multiple phone calls and emails and accept they are liable for compensation under EU261 guidelines. They then use every possible delay tactic and lie there way through every email and web chat conversation for months in the hope that the customer will give up asking for their refund. I have been waiting five months for a refund and have now had to pay out of my own pocket to take Ryanair to a small claims court. I suspect they will ignore these demands and carry on taking peoples money and ignoring any requests for customer service. I urge anyone thinking about purchasing a flight through this joke of a company to just take 1 minute to search for any review site online and see how bad they really are before you part with your money.

All the people from other Ryanair flights were piling up, waiting for the belt number announcement to reclaim their baggage. Most of them had been waiting for 30 minutes already. Ryanair did not give any information, just blamed Swissport! Also, there were 100s pieces of left luggage from the previous day in front of Ryanair's baggage information desk, adding to the total chaos! Total delay for me was 3h45', which costed me to miss all my evening. Ryanair sent through an email stating 2h54' delay. However, the official departure and arrival information, states 2h59' delay. Someone is not telling the truth. Compensation is given for 3h and more.

Just 15 minutes prior to take off, having checked in etc., flight was cancelled (along with a number of other Ryanair flights) because of heavy rain - funny thing was, every other airline was continuing to fly, there were no other cancellations. There were no Ryanair staff in the airport to help or advise - check-in was being handled by other (I presume airport) staff. So, because of the sudden number of Ryanair cancellations all happening at the same time, that meant there was something like 1000 people all queuing to speak to three, non-Ryanair, staff at the information desk. We managed to book flights on another Ryanair flight, 36 hours (and two expensive nights in a hotel) later.The one good thing? I don't work for Ryanair. I feel truly sorry fo the staff (when you can find them) - they try to be helpful, but they know they work for a bunch of cowboys who couldn't give a damn.

817,S Norton,"  Stansted to Budapest with Ryanair proved to be something of a mixed bag shall we say. I booked online and at the time thought the fare to be reasonable. The website was rather clear as to the charging policy and so I bought priority boarding and paid for a bag too. The priority boarding proved to be a false economy. Reaching Stansted was very expensive by train and entirely negated the few pounds saved against flights from my more local Heathrow. While the shambles of security at Stansted is beyond Ryanair I was concerned to see that my flight had not been on time once in 3 weeks. The bag drop was not well organised at all and the uniformed Ryanair staff member had a poor grasp of English. She actually walked away from an elderly German lady who asked for help with the bag tagging machine. The queue for the flight was poorly managed and regardless of my “priority” boarding I was one of the last to board due to the poor queue management. Sure enough, the flight was just over 1 hour late in departing for Budapest. The cabin crew were lovely people and very friendly and professional. The seat was fine for a short flight and the safety demonstration was conducted in a professional manner. If Ryanair could do something about the expensive train from Liverpool Street I would use their services again. However, due to the cost of reaching Stansted I shall look elsewhere for my next trip to Budapest.

818,Alastair Huber,"  Hamburg to Edinburgh. Unprofessional airline. My wife and I planned a trip together to visit my ancestral home of Scotland. We arrived at the airport at 04:55 am for a flight departing at 6:20. Ryanair does not have any staff to assist with baggage, instruction on how to get to the gate or that there is a preclearance requirement to travel to the UK, and no staff that assisted in any way including how to take baggage on the plane through security. We were among at least 12 people denied access to the flight as they didn’t have a shuttle to the airplane once to the gate. Everyone was extremely frustrated and left without an alternative and no one can provide help particularly if the booking was made online. Even the staff in Hamburg airport were unimpressed with Ryanair and noted this is simply the way they operate. The inexpensive fare was completely wasted and one loses the return flight if you don’t make the first flight. This is a “fine print airline” that may work for the experienced traveler with the patience to lose their money a few times in order to get the hang of their “method” but do not make the mistake of thinking that this is actually an air service.

819,T Mears,"  Barcelona to Dublin. Horrendous experience. I flew with this airline on a return flight to Barcelona. Both flights were delayed by 1hr 30mins to 2hrs. However, it was the manner that they were delayed that was most frustrating. For both delays there was no communication from the airline. When we arrived there was no mention of delay until it became apparent that there was still no plane at the gate at the listed time of departure. After 45mins waiting at the gate we were finally allowed on the aircraft. However, the delay continued for another hour on the plane where it was incredibly uncomfortable, stuffy and hot. Overall I arrived 2 hours later than what was listed with zero communication from the airline besides an apology text to my phone the next day. The whole experience was not acceptable, even from a company that seems to have a reputation for this type of experience. he flight was the most uncomfortable and rocky flight I've ever experienced (and I'm someone that usually enjoys flying). Ryanair preaches low cost, however considering the multitude of ridiculous extra fees (e.g you have to pay upwards of €15 for a seat even though you've already purchased a ticket?), the consistent delays, the lack of communication, the uncomfortable flights, and the low quality customer service, it is in my opinion far more worth avoiding this company and paying the little bit extra it costs to fly with another airline to guarantee a stress-free flying experience.",Economy Class,n,2018-07-11,barcelona dublin horrendous experience flew airline return flight barcelona flight delayed hr min hr however manner delayed frustrating delay communication airline arrived mention delay became apparent still plane gate listed time departure min waiting gate finally allowed aircraft however delay continued another hour plane incredibly uncomfortable stuffy hot overall arrived hour later listed zero communication airline besides apology text phone next day whole experience acceptable even company seems reputation type experience flight uncomfortable rocky flight ever experienced someone usually enjoys flying ryanair preaches low cost however considering multitude ridiculous extra fee e g pay upwards seat even though already purchased ticket consistent delay lack communication uncomfortable flight low quality customer service opinion far worth avoiding company paying little bit extra cost fly another airline guarantee stress free flying experience,-0.9761,Negative,958

828,A Richards," London to Barcelona. First time ever to fly with Ryanair and this has been an absolute disappointment from the very beginning to the end. Booked my ticket in May 2018 thinking I had a bargain compared to the prices shown by other airlines. I even selected the priority option costing a little extra. This meant I could carry a 10kg bag with a small bag. Arrived at the airport to drop my suitcase but was told I had to pay £50 because I didn't have this on my ticket. Completely shocked I argued but of course had no choice but to pay. After this the flight was delayed for almost 3 hours didn't arrive at my destination until 2am for a conference I had to attend by 8.30 the following morning. Well, thinking the nightmare was over and glad to have survived the ordeal. On my flight back, I thought perhaps the £50 I paid would have covered both leg of my trip only to be told that I needed to pay another £50 on my way back. Making a total of £100 pounds excluding the cost of my original ticket which was £98. While queuing pay for the cost of my laugage, I met several families who had exactly thesame problem as myself. Ryanair needs to state the exact cost implications of their flights. Now if I had known that this flight would have cost me almost £200, I certainly would have flown with British Airways without any doubt. Well, you learn every day.

831,K Richards,"  Edinburgh to Prague. I have no problem with the cabin crew. However the ground staff needs training in how to help passengers, not berate them. Most other airlines allow for a visa check at the gate. Not Ryanair. I was passed through security, appeared at the gate in plenty of time, but at the time to board I was told to go all the way back through security to a miniscule and obscure check-in desk to have my US passport checked for my flight to Prague. It didn't matter one bit that the Czech Republic is visa-free for US citizens, only that I was required to do this. Of course I was not able to make the flight, but even worse the gate attendant was outright rude, stating it was not her fault. The gist of it is she was right, but her completely unhelpful attitude also tripped out at least 4 other US citizens on the same flight. This regularly happens due to poor ground training and procedures. After writing a complaint to Ryanair customer service the response was predictable, no apology, it is the passengers' responsibility to check the visa requirements. Ryanair needs to amend their procedures and place a qualified individual after security and before boarding so there is no longer the need for paying customers to be inconvenienced by missing their flight.

So I have no idea how the plane, on flight service, seats, or anything related ot the flight were as I never made it on a plane. So we waited in line for 3 hours to speak with a customer service representative about booking an alternative flight. When we finally made it through the line (many, many flights were cancelled this day), we found out that ALL Ryanair flights for the next 2 days to every location were completely booked, so the soonest we would be able to get on another flight was 3 days later. We had limited time where we were going as we were on vacation. So we decided to book with another airline (same day meant that it was very expensive). The customer service representative told us we qualified for compensation to make up some of the extra cost, and actually told us it was a good thing we got on another airline with how quickly all their flights were filling up. When filing for that compensation, we were told the cancellation was outside of their control so they would only refund the flight. We were given many reasons why the flight was cancelled by various airport and airline employees. Ryanair was not even willing to compensate money I would have lost if I had rebooked on their airline and stayed in London the additional 3 days.

836,C Leare,"  The flight time from London Stansted to Nuremberg generally takes about 90 minutes. My flight was delayed by almost 3 hours, resulting in an arrival in Germany at 1am. When Ryanair does the basics well, it is a very good airline. I want to get to my destination safely and an on-time. I have used Ryanair for many years because it never seems to compromise on safety and has had an excellent on-time record.  Something is going wrong with flights from London Stansted, which, I believe, is Ryanair's largest base, as measured by aircraft and passenger numbers. When I travelled to Nuremberg, I noticed that a large number of flights were leaving with delays - my own flight's delay was the longest but delays of 40-60 minutes seemed routine. People have told me that there is an ongoing problem with Swissport, the ground agents at Stansted airport. This may be so but, at the end of the day, Ryanair is responsible for the agencies with which it has contracts and for the operation of its flights. When a ground agent is not available to staff a gate, that is, and should be, a reflection of Ryanair. in the case of my flight to Nuremberg, I was told that the plane was flying with delays because of a concatenation of events: a technical problem leading to a plane change earlier in the day; ongoing problems with Swissport; a loss of slot because of late servicing of aircraft by Swissport; ATC restrictions. The short flight passed without incident and the crew were competent and efficient. As usual, there was no-one available at Nuremberg to offer advice and assistance to passengers arriving almost 3-hours late.",Economy Class,y,2018-06-30,flight time london stansted nuremberg generally take minute flight delayed almost hour resulting arrival germany ryanair basic well good airline want get destination safely time used ryanair many year never seems compromise safety excellent time record something going wrong flight london stansted believe ryanair largest base measured aircraft passenger number travelled nuremberg noticed large number flight leaving delay flight delay longest delay minute seemed routine people told ongoing problem swissport ground agent stansted airport may end day ryanair responsible agency contract operation flight ground agent available staff gate reflection ryanair case flight nuremberg told plane flying delay concatenation event technical problem leading plane change earlier day ongoing problem swissport loss slot late servicing aircraft swissport atc restriction short flight passed without incident crew competent efficient usual one available nuremberg offer advice assistance passenger arriving almost hour late,-0.844,Negative,1013
837,Jared Scruggs,"  Barcelona to Venice. I would never recommend this airline to anyone. There are hidden fees (55 euros per way) for improper check-in, the site is faulty preventing check-in, and the customer service is not helpful or understanding.

It is virtually impossible to find a customer service email contact. My query is very simple but, as per, large companies such as Ryanair have no concept of customer service.

Outbound flight: Had no problems during the flight, we were on time, landed a little earlier, flight attendants were friendly (I sometimes tend to get sick and at first I panicked a bit as there were no sick bags but when I asked an attendant she gave me one). Unfortunately the crew was very hard to understand when they announced something on the microphone, I never understood them as the quality was very poor. One thing I didn't like is that we had a group of drunk guys on board and the crew didn't told them to be more quiet, they even sold more beer. Everything else was as expected. Inbound flights: Fine as well, departing and arrived approx. 15 minutes later than scheduled but okay. The flight itself was a little rough but not Ryanair's fault. It was a flight in the late evening and I wanted to sleep a little but the crew bothered a bit as they always tried to sell something like scratch cards. Everything else fine.

We couldn't leave the plane for about another 2 hours and sat there without anything to eat or drink. We directly went to the desk to book another flight, only option was Friday June 1st. The day we should arrive home. Or in two weeks. We asked them to check 6 different airports, but apparently no options available the next day.

873,N Carter,"Munich to Dublin. Had 2 flights with Ryanair, and each flight was the absolute worst. My girlfriend and I checked in 3 days in advance and we were not given seats next to each other, even though the tickets were ordered at the same time and we could *see* that the seats next to each of us were available. Ryanair then prompted us ""Want to sit together?"" We could upgrade. Basically they tried to charge us extra money to get the service that you get included in every other flight. Obviously we didn't do that, and when we got on the flight it was mostly empty and everyone could sit wherever they wanted. Ryanair wasn't doing this splitting the seating to 'improve seating algorithm' or 'allow larger groups'- they were doing it solely to milk another couple bucks out of us from our ticket. Same thing in a different vein for every other aspect of the trip from boarding to arriving - boarding groups, luggage, etc. There must have been a dozen different upgrades you could purchase to bring the quality of their ticket up to the standard quality of every other existing airline. Obviously every airline does this to some extent, but the breaking up seating was the one that really got to me. Their carry-on luggage options were just as bad on paper, though the actual flight attendants were very relaxed about what could and couldn't be brought on a flight. That might depend on the people though- on paper, you would struggle to bring anything onto this flight for free as a carry-on. Caused a lot of needless anxiety as we were preparing to leave our backpacks worked for 99% of other airlines, but would they cost us $80 to bring through Ryanair? If they aren't going to enforce the luggage stuff they should relax it on paper so it doesn't cause travelers so much stress. On top of that, every other part of the trip was irritating in every way. Boarding process started ~30 minutes late for both of our flights. They accidentally left us stuck in a hot and crowded staircase for half an hour waiting for a bus. At some point during the flight they tried to sell us scratch-off lottery tickets for additional flights, which was annoying and loud and also just plain *weird*. Despite how late we always boarded, the flight was never late. The pilots cut down the flight by a lot of time. Very noticeable in landing, I've dropped my phone with more grace than some of these landings. I guess this is technically a plus but feeling like your pilot is rushing is never a good feeling on a flight for me. In summary, it was a miserable experience all around.

884,M Baker," 
Pretty easy to book and get the flight I wanted for the price I considered fair. Very easy and straight forward booking process indeed. Very good value for money. As I had already done the online check in, which was very easy to do, I just went to the airport and went straight to the boarding gate. The flight had a slight delay, nothing serious and very unlike Ryanair which is very punctual but the weather was very bad and so it was normal to get delays. Boarding was simple and fast, and ground crew were nice and very efficient. No hassle at all. Boarding the plane was also fast, the plane was very clean and the crew were friendly and helpful as ever, I don't particularly like the Boeing 737, seats are narrower than in similar airbus (not Ryanair's fault, it is due to the plane) and I don't particularly like the orange on blue Ryanair scheme. Seats are adequately comfortable for a 2h flight but I wish they had some pockets in front of you to store your belongings. Overhead bins had sufficient space. Crew were friendly and had the usual drinks and food for passengers to buy and the flight was fast and uneventful. Very smooth flight. Deboarding was fast and I didn't have the need to wait for bags as I had not carried any checked in luggage.

Boarding was simple and fast, with very nice and efficient ground and air crews. The plane was very clean as always, and I must say I fly this route regularly with Ryanair and others and Ryanair is cleaner than some of their competitors. Also, I never got a dirty plane or seat in any Ryanair flight. We departed and arrived on time and the flight was smooth, with no problems. I did't buy inflight foods or drinks but there was a decent amount to choose form as there was enough duty free. when we arrived, picking up the checked in luggage was very fast and everything was ok with my bag.

When I went to board the flight I was told I could not as the payment had not gone through. I was told to go to arrivals and talk with someone in Skyline desk. I never received a email, text or phone call to say that the payment didn't go through.  I was given a piece of paper with website, call center and working hours. Could not get through to the phone number so went on live chat with Ryanair, got no help, then i told them how terrible it was to be left in Athens and then i was told to contact the Fraud Department - of course no response. I had to buy a ticket from a  travel agent at the airport (so helpful and understand of my situation), go to Paris and then Dublin with Air France, for 210 euro, but money and time well spent.

However they were the colleagues of my husband, so they bought it in his name.

We would buy the tickets individually. So we bought the tickets for my husband, all 4 vouchers went through fine. Then we were going to buy mine, when the system disagreed, because the vouchers were in my husband's name. We contacted RyanAir, to ask for a solution. They have been using our wedding present for almost a year, and we naturally wanted to get something out of it.

I installed Ryanair Apps to check in online (this is to avoid €55 charge for check in at the airport). I arranged my luggage not to exceed 20kg allowance.

918,J Dean,"  I have just tried to check in on line for a forthcoming trip to Milan with Ryanair, having had the debacle of trying to sit together with friends -  this is just not possible unless you pay extra up front again!! Thought I had solved the problem by paying an additional £6 PP Per flight for priority boarding. Only to discover that due again to their policy change this no longer includes early check in. The only way to sit together is to reserve your seats. Which is also a cheaper option than priority boarding but it doesn't tell you this when you make the booking. It is also not possible to change your Priority boarding to reserving a seat! The other point worth mentioning is that when you do book in the 4 day period before you fly, the Ryanair system seems to be designed to ensure that you are as far apart from your family as possible, which causes chaos at boarding as everyone then boards the flight and tries to sit with their family. If I have a choice Ryanair will be my last choice of carrier. No longer the cheap option they once were - they give you the distinct feeling they are trying to rip you off. Most certainly the worst of the cheap airlines! I will not use them again unless there is no other option - even if I have to pay more for the flight.

922,Joana Guerreiro," Ryanair is the worst airline. They’re are incredibly greedy for money and cant find enough ways to steal from you. I’ve flown with them before but never again! Firstly the ticket is affordable but each bag costs £40 which means the cost of bags will exceed the ticket (so flying with a more expensive airline with more benefits and quality assurance will technically equal the money you will spend with Ryanair). Secondly, unlike every other airline it now requires you to pay £6 (yes because £80 isnt enough) for you to be able to take a small bag on board. I took a small trolley bag as I knew this was the policy and they still tagged it. My bag had no lock, was not strong enough to be put in the deck and had very delicate things inside. They only gave me time to remove my computer and all my appliances/makeup/many other products were left to be thrown away in the deck (and we both know what happens, bag breaks and all my things inside break). The best part is they only tell you about this policy in an e-mail after you buy the ticket! Yes it is written in the small letters of the terms, yet they know we don't always read it all, especially when I’ve flown with them before and never had to do it so just assumed everthing was the same. When boarding, I realise half the top shelfs were empty which means this could all have been avoided, but like I said, money tops it all for this airline. No customer service quality, terrible unhappy and unfriendly staff in the airplane. All I know is that I have given so much time and money to this airline, but you can be sure I will never fly with them again.

923,A Cowan,"  Dublin to Rome Ciampino with Ryanair on 2 non priority tickets. We had bought 2 seats across an aisle together as they were 2.50 each and actually the plane had plenty of empty seats so we ended up sitting together. Had they been dearer I wouldn't have bought the seats and instead more than likely sat at opposite ends of the plane due to that crazy seating algorithm that needs to go! Boarding at Dublin swift and efficient and staff were very nice and courteous on outbound flight. On time arrival into CIA. Due to not having priority boarding our bags were taken off us at the aircraft and we weren't waiting long for them at the terminal. On the way back, a similar pattern, really nice staff on board, highly efficient and pleasant. Interestingly they turned off the cabin lights and toned down the service after about an hour which was really welcome. I have to say the constant selling is tiresome but on this flights the hour and half with dimmed lighted was very pleasant and appreciated by all passengers. Small delay on take off as wind was 15 knots which was too strong under Italian aviation law but we were well updated by flight deck. More notifications as we flew right over Paris and over Heathrow I wouldn't have any problems flying Ryanair again but play by the rules.

Not so. I contacted Ryanair with all of my proof of purchases, and got an email to say they would pay me nothing because of circumstances ""which was due to a general strike, outside of our control.""  I contacted the Ombudsman, Aviation ADR, and they contacted Ryanair on my behalf, and received a reply saying that they still would not compensate me. I went higher up and still nothing. I am continuing to fight this. I'm not going to say I will never fly with them again, because they are cheap.

925,B Cooper," I thought I would flag what appears to be a persistent problem for Ryanair passengers flying from Frankfurt and the lamentable response from ground crew and Frankfurt staff. Bag security takes place at the gate at Frankfurt T2, not on entering the departure lounge (only passport needed). I arrived at the gate ~50 mins before the flight departed (let's face it - at STN with Ryanair you only generally start to board ~5 mins before the departure time) to be confronted with a large queue, all for the same flight. Security did not seem unduly concerned. Far from being last in the queue unfortunately I was directed to a very slow moving parallel screening queue for Xrays etc - which did indeed leave me one of the last downstairs to the gate, where I was witness to a queue of some 20 people already arguing with the gate staff who told them they were ""late"" and could not board. The situation was made more ridiculous as there was a half-empty bus waiting outside, for at least 10 minutes while the team of 2 on the desk refused to let more people past. Eventually this bus departed, only for another one to turn up - again we were not allowed to board this by the gate staff. Someone else turned up and we were effectively told tough, go and re-book as they would not let us through. As a result families were split as the block was seemingly arbitrarily applied from one passenger to the next - which was appalling, moreover he had medication for his wife and they still would not let the guy through nor make any attempt to get these to him. Clearly there was no communication between security and the gate which was hugely frustrating, security was understaffed as they could not physically process the volume of passengers in the timeframe (if I were more suspicious I would think there may be some 'special arrangement' to engineer this). Moreover this happens regularly - one of the gate staff told us *45* people were denied boarding under similar circumstances the day before and a quick twitter search showed this happened at least once more this same week.

926,M Morgan," In the old days Ryanair meant ""Low fares simple"". Now it means ""Low fares with loads of hidden costs"". Very poor and unprofessional service from boarding to flight attendants. All starts at boarding where a tag with limited liability is attached to your hand luggage if you don't pay ""Priority"" (which btw, seems to be bought by half the passengers nowadays). The ""fake receipt"" is then glued onto your ID which once resulted in one staff member actually breaking my plastic ID card. This tag is so made up you can just rip it off and try your luck getting your hand bag into the cabin. If you are traveling with your SO or a child, expect to pay just to sit together because it will purposely ""randomly"" allocate you as far as possible. Inside the cabin, you'll find the worst flight attendants the aeronautic industry has to offer. Those who often bump into everyone and will actually hurt you when you have an aisle seat, obviously without any apologies, that keep selling lottery tickets enhancing the flea market spirit even when turbulence requires all passengers to be seated. They sometimes forget to perform the safety procedures demonstration from start because they're on the phone. I once even heard one of them screaming when we ""bumped"" into some turbulence! Good luck trying to sleep if there are constant announcements over food, perfumes, tickets and other diversified sales. Also, Ryanair seems to think they're above EU regulations, no beverages are offered in case of a significant delay. Now the plus: It's simple and sometimes very cheap (although it often requires you to waste tons of money and pay exorbitant train tickets to reach its remote airports) Ryanair keeps growing without proper scaling and training, disregarding its customers and aiming towards maximum profit only.

According to the ladies there checking our boarding passes, we had to have a visa card and they wouldn't board us on the plane. We thought there was a confusion since we arrived just fine with the same exact documents, same airline, same airport the day before and we had no problem through security but they appear to have a problem and wouldn't let us on the plane.

930,Christopher Rainbow,"  On this rather short 40 mins flight from Dublin to Glasgow, Ryanair proved to be ideal. They were punctual and reliable and the the check-in process was most efficient.

933,Janet Leeke," Flew Tallinn to London Stansted. Ryanair are one of those airlines that you choose as a last resort. They are just there to scrape every penny they can out of you. We wouldn’t book seats out of principle and refused to pay for priority boarding - this means we could only check in 4 days prior to flying. Luckily I was able to do this, if it was your week/fortnight holiday, you’d be stuck. My husband and son were on a separate booking to me as I had booked later. I checked them in first and got seats 9e and 20b. When I checked in next I got seat 9b. Clearly they could have given my husband seats near each other but they clearly want to make a point. Every time you press proceed you get asked if you want to change your seats at a cost. It’s a pathetic money grabbing system. When we followed this same procedure with Wizz Air, seats next to each other were allocated. The man sat next to me had paid £15 for his seat - I had paid nothing - ridiculous!

This airline has no consideration or respect to its customers. Even though the flight is cheap, one would expect a minimum of courtesy to explain the reason for the delay.

938,Kevin Barrance, Flew London Stansted to Cork. Very strange airline. I'm not sure how they got to where they are as I don't really enjoy flying with them. Peculiar practice of getting people who have not paid 'premium' to take their bags to the gate and then once boarding put them on a luggage cart for loading into the hold. I guess might as well get the passengers to do the heavy work! Soon I'm sure they'll be asking the customers to load the bags as well. Luckily I was only travelling out and back in a day and had a small notebook. The main thing is that I got there and back safely and that's really the only positive thing I can say.

Almost the same price to check in my luggage as I paid for my seat. The cabin crew could perhaps pay more attention to the passengers. When serving drinks and snacks, they missed out row 26 altogether. Slight delay due to a technical issue with the aircraft, however we were transferred efficiently to another aircraft, meaning the delay was restricted to *just* 61 minutes. I was travelling with a family member on the same booking, however, we were not allocated seats together. This is not the first time we have been separated in the past few months with Ryanair.

Sit next to your parnter - Add £24 to the cost of the journey. Add 1 check in bag - Add £80 to the cost of the journey. Take your carry on bags on board the plane - add £50 to the cost of the journey. The seats are the worst and most uncomfortable I have ever sat in on a plane and they seem to be adding more rows which means even less leg room, and I'm not a tall man so I really feel for people over 6 feet tall. They called the passengers to the gate and kept us waiting for over 45 additional minutes with nor aircon so it was like sitting in an oven.

948,B Comis ," Some days ago I made 2 bookings for a trip from Athens to Dublin and later on (the same day) I realised I needed to change the flight dates (and so I did) and proceeded to do it in the 24 hour grace period that Ryanair proclaims that it provides for this kind of changes. However, I was charged an extra total of 80 euros for both bookings (40 euros for each booking - 20 euros for each flight), although the old and new flight prices were exactly the same at the time of the change to the booking! Moreover, the aforementioned change happened in the 24 hours grace period (actually it was done less than 2-3 hours after the original booking). According to Ryanair's website and the 24 hour grace period (for this kind of changes) the dates change should have been at no cost (as the price of the flights at that time was exactly the same). I initially tried to address the situation with Ryanair's Live Chat customer assistance. But not only were they not helpful at all or even willing to try and check the reason for what happened, but they were also abrupt and rude. And of course no attempt at all at even pretending in trying to resolve my issue. Unfortunately, I have been a regular customer of the airline the last couple of years and I thought that if I address this matter through their website and the complaint forms (which by the way, good luck finding the proper link and form to submit one), that maybe they will be honest and upfront about the unfair charge and sort it out as soon as possible. I even sent them printscreens from the original flight prices (taken at the time of the booking and of course the new booking charges). However, the only reply I got back from Ryanair's customer service was a repeated standard reply prewritten form saying that the prices on the website are live and they may change at anytime (no one argued against that - however they don't even mention the fact that the prices were exactly the same) and that there can be a fee for changing the dates (no mention of the 24hour grace period). I confronted them replying to all these nonsense and they sent me the same reply, only to finally add the fact that once they receive a payment they cannot provide any refunds for any mistakes concerning the payment received (Great business policy, right?). Never trust Ryanair for anything.

949,Brittany Christophel,"  Madrid to Marrakesh. Ryanair, while servicing its customers with prices that are reasonable for flights in nearby countries (such as in my case, when visiting Spain, and flying to Morocco), knows nothing about customer satisfaction or conflict resolution. Aside from experiencing technical difficulties upon departing to Morocco when trying to check-in, my flight prior to and when boarding was equal, and my experience incredibly poor. The flight was announced to be delayed only 30 minutes, when the plane really landed over 2 hours later than scheduled. This caused for me to be stranded at the airport late in the night, as I arranged with my hotel to be picked up from the Marrakesh (RAK) airport, making me feel very unsafe. During the flight, one of the male flight attendants was being very flirtatiously aggressive with two women traveling together that I was sitting next to on the plane. Every time, in passing, the male flight attendant would take the opportunity to engage in unprofessional behavior with one girl in particular. At one point, the two exchanged phone numbers and planned to meet after the flight landed in Marrakesh (RAK), and this event caught the attention of other passengers on the flight. Also, en route, many of the passengers that were traveling in groups were kneeling in the seats, and talking to friends that were sitting behind them. This happened in multiple groups and was never addressed by airline staff. My experience with Ryanair has been frustrating and communicated very clearly to those working with Ryanair, three times. Unfortunately, it seems that Ryanair is a company that knows its own rules and regulations very well, and if you do not (as a passenger), you are considered unfortunate and will only receive a mere apology for any uneventful experience had with the airline.

Usual long walk at GLA to the gate, this time on the main International Pier. Priority Boarding was enforced by the gate staff, who were keeping the queue well organised and started to board on time.

Very standard level of service on board, goods sold efficiently and the usual Ryanair announcements made. No word from the flight deck at all which was strange.

953,Nicolaie Adam,"  Berlin to Bucharest. They were late and the staff was agitated because of it. They boarded priority travellers first without checking their tickets, so that half of the travellers profited and skipped the line without having the right to do so. We didn't want to ruin our evening, so we didn't object, we just wanted to get home smoothly. After boarding the aircraft and after having found a small space in the cabin storage compartment to store our coats, two late passengers arrived, each of them carrying a rather large suitcase. Without saying anything, the flight attendant took our coats out of the storage compartment from above our heads and into my wife's lap. She then pushed one of the suitcases inside and left. No explanation, no intention of helping us store our coats somewhere else. My wife stood up and tried to store the coats somewhere else. This got the staff angry, because they were keen on making up lost time and wanted to depart as soon as possible. They started shouting through the microphone, urging everybody to take their seats and saying that taking your seat is really easy to do. Not only were we denied our minimal confort, decency and respect, but they were now also offending us in public. When I asked them, during the flight, if their attitude seemed normal to them, they started shouting again and they immediately joined the one I was adressing as to create pressure and intimidate us.

A few days before we were due to fly there was the threat of Ryanair going on strike on the day of our flight 20th Dec, which had me regretting my choice however it was averted and our scheduled flight was unaffected. The flight itself was as good as can be expected. The cabin crew especially 1 young woman was friendly and welcoming. As there were several empty seats at the front they allowed passengers to use those seats. The plane took off more or less on time and arrived to Birmingham on schedule. 1 thing I will say about the priority boarding is, it's worth the extra money, it allows you and your partner/family sit together and gives some order to boarding having 2 lanes, I remember when it was 1 queue of boarding it was chaotic and seemed much longer to board.",Economy Class,y,2018-01-23,booked ryanair hope expectation fly madrid birmingham preferred fly iberia express fly day compatible schedule day due fly threat ryanair going strike day flight th dec regretting choice however averted scheduled flight unaffected flight good expected cabin crew especially young woman friendly welcoming several empty seat front allowed passenger use seat plane took le time arrived birmingham schedule thing say priority boarding worth extra money allows partner family sit together give order boarding lane remember queue boarding chaotic seemed much longer board,0.2878,Neutral,566

956,Ann Hatzimangas," Flew Knock to Athens via Stansted. I had a ""Priority "" ticket"". Even though I flew all the way with Ryanair I had to purchase two separate tickets and therefore had to check in twice. Once in Knock and again in Stansted. We were an hour late leaving Knock, no apologies or explanation. My flight to Athens was for 6.10pm but I wasn't allowed to go to the departure lounge until check in opened and had to hang around the arrival hall for three hours. One coffee shop and a fast food joint, nowhere to sit. Finally get to check in and there aren't any employees! In the check in area, 10 out of 20 weigh stations weren't working and when I found one that worked it was after three attempts. There was one lady outside the check in counter and her job was to tell you to lift your case into the conveyor belt and scan the boarding pass. Didn't offer to help anyone. I checked in one case and had one carry-on and a small bag. The carry on was fine from Knock to Stansted but was not acceptable Stansted to Athens! This I learned while boarding so my carry on went into the cargo. I didn't have time to open it to get some items that I wanted to ""carry-on"". Flight was supposed to leave at 6.10pm.

957,E Varikoca,"  Bratislava to Stansted via Aalborg. That Ryanair is low fare is well known and so I did expect not to have much space on the plane and that I was able to take one bag into the cabin if lucky. When I was already sitting on the plane from Bratislava to Stansted I received my e-mail that my flight from Stansted to Aalborg was canceled and I could not get off the plane to Stansted because it was too late. In Stansted, I was told that I have to wait 26 hours for a next flight and I had a right to have a refund and at least a hotel room where to stay till the next day. After waiting for 7 hours at the customer service I was told to wait for extra 2 hours just so they will check if there is any hotel room available. After another 3 hours they told me at the customer service that they don't know anything about a hotel room and that they will give me a standby ticket to Billund and I can try to catch it, because in that time I had less than an hour and there have been more standby tickets and they took just limited amount of them. It was hell, but after problems at the airport check-in and running for life (and plane) I got there. I arrived in Billund at late night and I had to travel to Aalborg by buses until the morning. I asked for refunds and they told me that I will receive them within 10 working days. That was in September 2017. I did not receive anything and I tried to contact them multiple times but either I was ignored completely or they just wrote me that they forwarded my e-mails and complains to different departments. In December 2017 I finally was able to contact them and account department of Ryanair wrote me that I will have my refunds on my account within 28 days. 28 working days passed and I haven't seen a penny. Honestly, I would not recommend using this airline no matter what. If you have a chance to use a different airline or transport please do.

958,G Martin," Really disappointed about all the supplements you have to pay after buying the ticket. The new rules about not having the right to bring your hand luggage with you on the plane (small purse + small hand luggage as typical) is absurd. Now you have to pay to be sure not to get it in the hold. In my case, I had another flight to catch so I needed to have my hand luggage with me which forced me to pay the extra price. Furthermore, we are two travelling, and when I made the checkin online the system gave us two seats far away from each other. Next option was; ""You are sitting apart, do you want to sit next to each other?"" Click yes, and an extra supplement is charged to change one of the seats to be next to the other one.

Also, it's really great that they abolished the visa check requirement for Schengen flights for non-EU passport holders. All flights were completely booked but this didn't cause any problems.

972,Michele Caforio," First time on holiday with Ryanair flying from Milan to Catania, I booked for 8 people. Check in has been a bad suprise, since the ""random"" seat assignment resulted in 8 people seating in 8 different rows! Before confirming this seat assignement a notice prompted me to pay if I wanted the freedom to choose seats. This is exactly as any other low cost airline promises in theory, since most airlines advertises that you have to pay to choose your seat. Recent experiences on other low cost airlines (easyJet, Wizz Air, Vueling) however resulted in all the people booked together being seated together without any extra cost. For this reason I was surprised to have all of us scattered around the plane. Except this, the flight was good and on time. Seat Comfort is average for low cost. Anyway I feel this ""trying to force"" the extra charge for choosing the seat is a bit rude and out of common low cost market practices.

I only had one bus to go to from the airport of my arrival to my destination and that bus was scheduled for 1:30h after a normal arrival. Since the flight arrived around 2:30h late, I missed the bus. I couldn't get the bus ticket refunded (20€ to waste) and I had to stay in the airport for 10 hours waiting for the next bus as I was traveling alone and leaving the airport with heavy luggage is not comfortable at all.

976,L Atkins,"  Tel Aviv to Paphos. EasyJet pricing is much more transparent and their customer service is substantially better. Ryanair seems like a good deal at first but suffers from obnoxious pricing schemes (randomly allocated seating just makes a huge mess at takeoff and serves no logistical purpose besides coercing you into paying an extra 25 Euro per person to sit next to your family) and absolutely terrible customer service that refuses to directly answer the questions you ask them. First they had a mistake on their website when I booked, causing me to pay for unnecessary priority boarding. At the airport we didn't actually get priority booking because a bus took us to the plane which was full of passengers who didn't pay for priority booking and we boarded after them. When I contacted customer service they refuse to acknowledge the initial mistake so I asked them questions about the new baggage policy which they won't answer directly, but simply copy and paste from the website (I can actually read, thanks). When I explained that I didn't even get the priority boarding that I paid for I get another copy and paste about how they are a non-refundable airline. It's impossible to have a dialogue with the customer service team because there's no way to answer on the same thread that you opened, even when I went through their complicated Contact Us menu, and try to update an existing complaint, the system said that the customer service number I've been given is not valid as it is 7 digits instead of 6.

980,Hendrik Nyman," Podgorica to Stockholm. This airline doesn't have a very good reputation for service, so expectations were low. But since the route was perfect for me, I still chose it. And I was positively surprised. Having recently flown a major carrier I actually found the Ryanair flight better. Check in is easily done with their mobile app, and it is of course a bit annoying that you have to pay extra to choose your seat. But still a lot better than it used to be when you had to stand in line to get a decent seat. They also have a very good system for cabin luggage. Either you can pay to take it on board, otherwise they only allow a limited number of large cabin bags, the others will be placed in the hold free of charge. This makes boarding much easier, and you can actually find place for your duty free bags and coats in the plane, something that can be almost impossible on other airlines. They now also allow an extra small item, which is far better than they used to be. I was also surprised by the leg room, which was good even for me who is quite tall. Since the seatbacks cannot be reclined you don't end up with someones seatback very close to you. The next surprise was their meal service, where they served good food for low prices. I even manage to find a gluten free meal, which was easy to determine since all items were clearly marked with allergene symbols. The departure was delayed for an hour due to snow in Sweden, and before landing we had to wait more while the runway was cleared from snow. But I found all staff very professional and pleasant. Ryanair used to be an annoying airline with bad passenger service. But while other airlines are constantly deteriorating and copying the low cost airlines I am happy to say that Ryanair is getting better and better.

I believed this was to stop the system splitting a child up from at least one of the parents.

983,S Naryan,"  Liverpool to Barcelona. I travelled with two kids and even though the staff could see me struggling to fold a double buggy whilst carrying a heavy bag and a baby they offered no help or assistance. Thankfully other passengers helped me to get on board. When I was on the return flight home same happened, didn't even bother to ask. At one point my daughter had dropped some pringles which we paid ridiculous amounts for and a passenger stepped on them so I couldn't pick up the little crumbs.  The crew member walked past and picked up the crisps and muttered other passengers have to board this plane too you know. I just thought how rude! And also why do they not clean the aircraft between journeys! It was filthy to start with. Greasy seats and magazines on the floor! Just shows you get what you pay for. If the service was better then it would have been full marks!

One thing that I did not like - and which I haven't experienced when flying Ryanair before - is that the system for the online check-in is splitting up Groups on purpose to make you pay for a reserved seat. However, 5 euros are okay for a seat reservation.

I clicked check-in on my reservation email, and they up-sold me seats for $90 during the online check-in, which was fine, and I finished the process. When I went to the airport, they told me we hadn't checked in and that we just paid $90 for regular seats, not even together with my girlfriend, and not in any special part of the plane. Insisted we had to pay another 50 euro each to check-in. I told the customer service to bring a manager to speak to and he denied it saying we could speak with him. I took a picture of the ""Ryanair customer service"" sign in order to give them a bad review, and he freaked out and told us ""You will no longer fly"", and even though we were there 2 hours before, didn't let us fly.

If you do not have tickets confirmed and printed before 2 hours expect the printing to cost as much as the flight itself. Upon going to the gate the people at the ticket desk were randomly telling people their bags were too big and charging them 50 euros to check at the gate. There was no rhyme or reason to it people were selected at random. Some had larger bags that were getting through those that were stopped.

They say you can take baby equipment safely enclosed in a box or hard case so long as it doesn't exceed 119x119x80cm and a max of 20kg and truly, flying out from Stansted is fine because that is the rule - however when you come back home its another matter. You are only allowed 1xbaby equipment max of 5kg despite the fact of going out you can have two free baby equipment and we paid for an extra one too. We were charged for having less coming back home as we exceeded the rule. They have a different rule for every country you go to apparently and also they commented that we were yet another of the same case.

993,J Olvany,"  Budapest to Dublin. I have flown on many different discount airlines, both inside the states and outside mainly in Europe. I've never had a worse travelling experience than with Ryanair. The airline has yet to be on time for flights, and for this trip was delayed both ways significantly. (An hour sitting on the flight to Dublin and already 20 mins to Budapest.) The attendants are rude and unhelpful and do not provide any useful information. For example, telling the cabin the delay is from a attendant who was going home because he's sick instead of the reality that he never showed up, which is what was said earlier. It wasn't that only instance where the staff acted errantly. On the way back to Budapest my fiance and I got belligerently approached by a staff member who demanded to know why our ""Visa Check"" had not been completed and that she didn't have time to check it herself. (Even though we've been waiting in the delayed priority line for the plane for 20 mins). I tried to explain to her that the staff we dropped our luggage off with said we had nothing else to do but go to security. Finally, the website also needs to have a better system of checks when offering other services, like car rental. My fiance and I rented and paid for a car in Dublin, knowing that an extra fee is often charged to people under 25. The site gave no indication that this wasn't taken in account for, or that there was an issue with our rental. When we showed up the company would not give us a car, and did not offer us a way to contact the airline for a refund. We have yet to get a reply from customer service in their limited and costly to call internationally hours.

994,S Vallarte,"  Copenhagen to Stansted. I and my mate were assigned to two distant seats, even though next to both there were two seats empty. The airline puts its best efforts to make its flight miserable. Via the airline Web site I also rented a car, which I was unable to collect due to a clause, (the rental agreement was 20 pages), which requires the UK driver to produce a DVLA (Driver Licence Agency) passcode. The DVLA Web site was not available when I attempted to collect the car. So, the car rental required an additional £15.00 in order to use a Premium Help Line and get the passcode. Last, but not least, they asked me to sign a clause granting the rental car company to charge my credit/debit card of any fee, fines, even if I was not present. It appeared to me as to sign a blank cheque. What you pay is what you get from Ryanair. I will stick on booking the airplane seat only for the time being.",Economy Class,n,2017-11-22,copenhagen stansted mate assigned two distant seat even though next two seat empty airline put best effort make flight miserable via airline web site also rented car unable collect due clause rental agreement page requires uk driver produce dvla driver licence agency passcode dvla web site available attempted collect car car rental required additional order use premium help line get passcode last least asked sign clause granting rental car company charge credit debit card fee fine even present appeared sign blank cheque pay get ryanair stick booking airplane seat time,0.886,Positive,574
995,S Mastoureux,"  Stansted to Limoges. Possibly the worst airline customer service. As I checked in the agent handed me back my boarding pass and travel documents but kept my passport by mistake. By the time I realized it was missing, I was at the gate but with 40mins to spare till the flight went. I though a simple phone call to the check in agent would solve the issue. First there was no signs of any Ryanair staff at the gate. Only Swissport agents who could not care less about my issue. I had to insist for them to ring the check in desk. The agent acknowledged they had my passport. However they would not bring it back to me. I had to go get it myself. The gate being the furthest away meant a 20 min run both way. In short there was no way I could exit security and return to the gate on time to catch my flight. I asked them if they could wait for me for a few extra minutes rather than offloading my bags. Their answer was no, and the gate will be closing soon too. Any airline who respect their passengers would have had the passport rushed to the gate on time by one of their staff. Especially so since it was the check in staff fault.  As a result I ended up missing my flight and best of all I had to pay a re-booking fee of 100 pounds, even though it was the check in staff fault. I also had to book a room at the airport hotel which cost me another 100 pounds. I did wrote to Ryanair about the issue and other than standards letter of apologies explaining that they can't be held responsible for the agents lack of support they were not prepared to cover any extra cost involved. This is a gross misconduct coming from Ryanair. Ryanair already have a very bad reputation, and this is just adding on to that pile.

To put me on the next flight, they charged a fee of £105. Even when there were about 5 seats available on the next flight, according to the representative who took my plight. Meaning, I paid extra £105 for a flight that had previously cost me €5. All other airlines are willing to accommodate this kind of extreme situation, except for Ryanair. Poorly managed, terrible customer service, and on top of it all, they make it extremely hard for people to complain (try and look for their Customer Service number).

A few days ago, I received an email saying that I had to ""check in"" for my flight online, a flight that was supposedly ""cancelled"". I talked to support for almost an hour, and they're still talking to me while I type this review because they're claiming that after the booking was ""cancelled"" they tried my card several more times until it was successful. Now that would have been perfectly fine if I was told that my card was continuously being tried as the payment method; or I was told when my card worked and that I would have been charged the money. In either of those cases I would not have spent more money in order to buy a new ticket from a different airline. Support also claimed that they have ""no cancellation policy"" - which is not even the situation right now. I'm only looking for a refund on the ticket that was presumably ""cancelled"" which still charged my credit card - which they say they ""cannot do anything about"".

Everything went well. The flight was on time departing and arrived 10 minutes early. Ground staff and flight crew were all charming. Flight almost full and several cabin bags ended up in the hold, but all passengers affected seemed to be content about the arrangement as they did not have to pay extra. Most noticeable that several passengers also brought more than their cabin bag allowance on board, both in number of bags and in the size of some of them. Some bags removed to the hold were too large for the overhead lockers. I have never yet had any problems with Ryanair, their service or their website. I have always found the website clear and easy to use, and I am not very computer literate. I have used this route with Ryanair ever since it started operating from Stansted to Carcassonne many years ago, and on only two occasions has anything gone wrong, and on both occasions, the weather caused diversion to another local airport.

You get the feeling like they are strict only about matters that are in Ryanair's interest, such as those that translate into revenues, because the oversize fee wasn't exactly ""lowcost"" - it was almost the same price as the flight. All luggage costs in total were the same as what I paid for the flight, so i paid double. So much for lowcost. I felt ripped off and also felt the underlying greedy vibe of a company that only uses the ""lowcost"" label as a means to market and boost their brand.

Both times when we checked in we have been allocated separate seats even though the plane wasn't at its full capacity. Both me and my friend had a free seat next to us. When I did the check in online I couldn't select my own seat as I used to be able to do even though there was a free seat next to me. I had to pay extra just to sit next to my friend.

1014,Liudmila Gnezdilova,"  My two friends and I were very unlucky to fly with Ryanair during the mass strike in France this October. We were supposed to fly from Alicante to Kaunas on the 10th of October, but when we arrived to the airport it appeared that our flight was delayed. We waited for ages, then they put us to the plane, where we waited further. Then they returned us back to the airport and said that our flight was canceled due to the strike in France. Not delayed but canceled! Now we only had the option of getting back our money (which was ridiculous, since with this little money we could not possibly buy a flight with another company) or waiting while Ryanair offers us something else. We chose the last variant since we are pensioners and don't have spare money, and we especially chose Ryanair because they offer the lowest prices. We stood in the biggest queue for the whole night! Thank goodness there were 3 of us and we could substitute one another. Throughout the night Ryanair never offered us even a bottle of water! When it was finally our turn to apply for a change of flight, Ryanair offered us a flight for the 18th October! They were only were willing to pay for one night's stay for us (and this chance had already passed since that was the night we spent in the queue). How we were supposed to live until the 18th October in a foreign country apparently did not concern them. Since we needed to go to Kaunas (Lithuania) we finally managed to board a plane going to Poznan (Poland) which was the closest destination to Kaunas and flew with it. I must say that Ryanair behaved so unprofessionally through the whole situation. Not to offer water to the passengers was the last drop really.

1015,Christian France,"  Stansted to Hamburg. I booked a flight with Ryanair to go see my girlfriend, within 10 seconds of paying for my flight I realised I booked the wrong date. At this point I had just paid £75 for a flight I didn't need, thinking I might be able to change flights, I called Ryanair and asked for my flight to be changed. I called and spoke to a lovely girl and great at customer handling, I asked if she could change my flight so that I could fly the weekend before the week I booked. She looked at the flights and said as I'm in the 24 hour period I wont be charged, Great, she did say that the flights I booked totalled £66 so I would be losing out on £9, a bit annoying but not end of the world. How wrong was I, apparently Ryanair have a policy that if you need to re-book the flight, you will get charged or not is not done on the total cost of the flights, but on the individual costings of each flight and compared with the flight you originally booked. So I looked at the flights and yes my flight there was in fact more expensive than the flight there for thew following weekend, then I look at the flight back and the new flight back is £25 more expensive, so I now not only lost £10 on the total cost change going from my original flight to the new flight I have now lost another £25 because I want to change the flight. So Ryanair have now got an extra £30 out of my 10 second mishap, one mistake I shall never make again, I will never fly with Ryanair again.  Ryanair are stingy when it comes to releasing cash, they have changed flight times for 3+ flight of mine in the past.

1018,H Tai,"  Glasgow to Sofia. My flight was delayed for 3hrs, I was stuck at the airport and waited. By the time I got to my destination, Sofia it was past midnight. Metro has stopped running, the only way to get into the city centre was via taxi. Since I’m a budget traveler, I didn’t want to waste money on the taxi, so I decided to sleep at the airport and wasted the money for the night of hostel I booked. A day or 2 after, I got an email about flight delays, and only just found out that there was an EU law that any flight delays for 3 hrs and more, the customer is entitled to a claim. I immediately submitted the claim. About a week later, Ryanair rejected my claim, saying my delay was under 3 hrs! Well, the flight was delayed 3 hrs exactly, we didn’t board until 3 hrs later, but it could have landed less than 3 hrs later, which I wouldn’t know, because I didn’t check the exact time I landed, it could be about 2hr 50min later than expected in Sofia. Ryanair also said, any flights that are delayed more than 1.5hr, customers are entitled to claim back expenses during the wait at the airport, providing receipts are provided. At the same time, they closed my case. I took this as a complaint, I asked for the exact time it landed in Sofia; asked for the reason of the delay; explained due to the delay, I lost a night at the hostel, and had to explain to them that I had to sleep at the airport; and why no one informed us there would be spending expenses for delays over 1.5hr?  When I got a reply from Ryanair, the staff was not even answering any of my questions, he just repeated the same thing as the first person said, told me to submit any receipts. Also that the flight was delayed for less than 3 hrs, so I was entitled to the 3hr+ claim. I tried again, explaining this further, but once again, it was no use. They were not doing anything about it. I just wanted to warn anyone flying around Europe, if there’re any delays, make sure you check the time, and make a record of it if possible. You can always get it from the website afterwards and save a record for it, if you need any claims. If it’s delayed for less than 3 hrs, check the airline’s policy and see what you’re entitled to. Because obviously they would not just tell you the freebies you could be entitled to, to save their cost! Anyway, Ryanair service is bad, all the emails I had with them back and forth, they were terrible. A different staff reply to my email every time, just repeating the same things over and over again, and not answering to my questions.

Outbound flight, my hand luggage had to be placed in the hold because apparently only 90 bags are allowed in the cabin.  There was plenty space for many other bags in the cabin - strange procedure. Outbound flight staff were rude. Didn’t smile. Were not polite and too busy flirting and handing out their number to a group of lads rather than dealing with their other customers. Money making scam! We would have had to pay a further £27pp on both outbound and inbound to sit together. Inbound flight I was row 31 (very back) and my boyfriend was row 3 (front). What would happen if there was a potential emergency? All you would want is to be close to your loved ones or the people you have come away with.

1022,L Cadwallader," I booked the flights with Ryanair months ago on the basis of price and appropriate dates, only to have the goalposts moved later, so that I needed to pay for seats in order to ensure that my wife and I sat together. Later still, the cancellation farrago threw the whole holiday into doubt until Ryanair was forced to publish the lists of flights affected and we learned that our flights were still on. Then the day before we flew we received an email warning of a ban on carrying alcohol into the cabin and telling us what would happen to any alcohol bought in the ""duty-free"" shops. This did not affect us directly as we never buy any ""duty-free"" but we did wonder whether the flight was going to be full of hen and stag parties. By then, any faith we might have had in Ryanair was pretty well dispelled and we had no high hopes of the flights themselves. In the event everything went fairly smoothly. Boarding for the outward flight was handled efficiently by a single agent while the cabin crew were both pleasant and hardworking. The cabin manager, in particular, carried out her duties very responsibly (for example, not starting the safety demonstration until she was sure that she had the attention of practically everyone on board) but with good humour. There was some changing of seats before we departed, but we were only a few minutes late rolling back. We arrived early (cue the awful triumphal blast) after an uneventful journey. For the return flight, boarding was slightly delayed though it did not impact upon our actual departure time. The cabin crew again worked hard but it was difficult to hear any of their announcements, due to the speed with which they were made plus the conversation level within the cabin. The actual flight was equally uneventful and we arrived marginally early, so we had the trumpet blast again, which this time was greeted by ironic cheers. After all the various alarms beforehand, therefore, we made it there and back without any real bother, but my wife and I have still decided that we will do our best to avoid Ryanair in the future. How can you trust a company that changes the rules after you have booked, yet denies it has done so, or cancels flights on a whim and tries to wriggle out of any of the consequences?

1023,Mark Curran,"  Liverpool to Dublin. My partner and myself flew to Dublin for a day out. After going through the booking system online and reading some of the reviews online we were not looking forward to the flight. The booking system is quite obviously setup to seat people as far apart as possible so the priority seating charge can be applied to sit together, this method leaves you with a feeling of being ripped off, a fact born out in most reviews we read. I personally would prefer the £3 to be automatically applied to the fare with an option to be randomly seated for £3 less, this would leave you feeling you had a bargain instead and cut down complaints and as most people prefer to travel together the airline would probably make more from it and everyone would be happy. We recieved 3 reminder emails from ryanair prompting us to check in online and avoid the airport checkin charge which was good. We were pleasantly surprised by the flights, both journeys were on time and even landed ahead of schedule. The planes were clean and looked new and the staff were proffessional and curtious. At dublin after dropping our hire car we underestimated the time it would take to get through security as it was very busy and by the time we got through our gate was closed. After a mad run the full length of terminal 1 we got to the gate 10 minutes before take off with the gate deserted. However after jumping up and down and waving to the pilots who we could see through the windows, he instructed one of the ground crew to come and get us and bring us to the plane, cant thank him enough.

1028,R Benson,"  Liverpool to Prague. Booked with Ryanair despite all the recent bad publicity and were lucky to not have our flights cancelled. Thought we had paid for seats next to each other on the flight out but the transaction mustn't have completed as I ended up in seat 8d and my husband was sat in 32d. Rather a dramatic difference, but then I suppose that is how they rinse you of more money! I'd come to terms with not taking a suitcase for a whopping £80 return, so I had squashed my stuff into a little hand suitcase and was happy with the fact you had no waiting time at the other end for your case. Unfortunately, as we got to the gate to board the plane, I was told my little case was to go into the hold for free as there were now more than 90 passengers with hand luggage! But it didn't get whisked off by a memeber of staff, oh no, I had to carry it down the steps, and put the thing on the suitcase truck myself! Once aboard the plane and once we realised that our seats were at the other end of the plane, I sat down in my seat and crossed my fingers for a good flight out in between all the stag and hen dos shouting to one another as none of them were sat next to each other either! Makes sense that doesn't it! So we set off on time and the cabin crew have to ask 4 times for everyone to shut up while they carry out the safety demonstration. Four times they got ignored! Throughout the flight, the toilet queue was always 10 people deep, the cabin crew were abused left right and centre by the passengers but eventually we landed safely. Peeved that I had to the stand in another queue waiting for my suitcase, having purposely not spend £80 for the pleasure of not having to wait for it, we stood waiting for 10mins to pick it up. The flight home was much quieter, much smoother and minus so many hen and stags. We paid the extra £4.08 for my husband to sit in front of me and someone kindly offered to swap so we could sit together. I was able to take my little case on board and we all made it home in one piece.

1031,E Handen,"  Glasgow to Dublin. Absolutely horrifically awful. We got some warnings on this airline, and I wish I had heeded them. It's true that they have the best price initially, but they have so many hidden costs it's obscene and I really feel strongly that a reputable airline is the way to go. I will never fly with Ryanair again. The staff member we met to check in was the rudest person I had ever dealt with in customer service - I don't even know how to describe it, the whole interaction left me in a very sour mood - she informed us that because we had not done the online checkin two hours before our flight (we were standing in front her 1 hour and 45 minutes before our flight, without exaggeration), we now had to pay £100 to have her check us in. This was more than both our tickets combined. It was 6:30 in the morning, and we were the only ones there. I couldn't believe it. The next lady we spoke to who was charging us this fee advised that we had 'checked our email wrong' since there should have been a reminder (there wasn't- I went back and checked, even the junk box). The booking email does mention this fee at the end of the page. If this airline wants to save money by limiting staff and doing things online, I support that - but I should have still been able to check in myself then at that time - to cut off the online checkin 2 hours before and charge a ridiculous fee at that time is just shady, wrong and I felt so angry. They already have additional costs for everything - we had paid to check our bags, and we had paid extra for 'priority' seating so our seats were already reserved - so why would we check in??? So angry and disappointed.

1032,B Sorano,"  Rome to Krakow. I had good luck and my trip was not cancelled, but I was surprized how Ryanair prices have lost transparency compared to some time ago, now you have to pay a lot for many things that previously were free or cost much less. I chose a flight for 86 Euro round trip, and ended up paying 170 Euros. A registred baggage of 15 kg now costs 35 Euro (compared to 15 not so much time ago), if you want to sit near a person you travel together with you have to pay (previously persons checking in together were placed beside each others). Even web check-in is not free if you do it more than 4 days before the trip (previously it was).

1033,B Sorano,"  Krakow to Rome Ciampnio. The flight itself it was usual, standard low-cost (lack of) service, and flight arrived on time. I have to complain about 3 things: 1) lack of price transparency - it is almost a trap. I chosed a round trip for 86 Euro, and, at the end, the final price was 170 Euro, having to pay 35 Euro for registered baggage of 15 kg and for doing the web check-in. 2) Badly organized website. I filled in ""billing address"" section when I made the ticket, thus expecting to get an invoce, only to discover later that Ryanair does not issue invoices for international flights without VAT - something there was no notice about. This caused me a lot of problems. 3) Badly handled customer care. I contacted them via live chat to solve problem listed under number 2 and I was promptly dismissed. I could email them, I was told.

But I really hope people don't pay as this is typical of the management at Ryanair. In flight from stansted to Riga the cabin crew announced that the the money from the scratch cards goes to charity. The priority boarding was funny from Riga to Stansted - they let both queues in at the same time - can you imagine paying to be let onto the plane at the same time.

1041,M Hailes,"  Dublin to Amsterdam. Significant delays experienced on both legs of our journey - 2 hours on the way out which seriously interfered with our plans, including a very uncomfortable 45 minutes sitting on a packed plane on the runway, and 2.5 hours on the return journey. Updated announcements for both delays were fed out incrementally every 10-15 minutes, when we could clearly see that the plane was still on the tarmac at the other end and had no hope of reaching AMS/ DUB for at least 90 minutes. To top it off, once on board, it was announced that the Captain was ""negotiating with ATC"" but with no success, when in reality the Ryanair aircraft on this route had missed their time slot earlier in the day resulting in each subsequent flight being pushed back. The staff on the return flight looked really weary but were troopers and delivered good service. Aircraft on both legs were untidy with detritus from previous passengers. Thankfully we had paid for priority boarding and seats and so apart from the inconvenience, were somewhat insulated from the full brunt.",Economy Class,n,2017-09-13,dublin amsterdam significant delay experienced leg journey hour way seriously interfered plan including uncomfortable minute sitting packed plane runway hour return journey updated announcement delay fed incrementally every minute could clearly see plane still tarmac end hope reaching am dub least minute top board announced captain negotiating atc success reality ryanair aircraft route missed time slot earlier day resulting subsequent flight pushed back staff return flight looked really weary trooper delivered good service aircraft leg untidy detritus previous passenger thankfully paid priority boarding seat apart inconvenience somewhat insulated full brunt,0.6605,Positive,665

I contacted Ryanair only to be told they were a non refund company and that my only option was to cancel the flight or sit in our seats. We had delays both sides, the cabin staff wouldn't take litter off anyone until the end of the flight. I know not all airlines provide complimentary food but I think £13 is ridiculous for a rubbish toasty and a water. It was 4.5 hour flight that was delayed you would think there would be something.

I saw the same bag inside the airplane with no ""oversized"" ticket on them.

1046,F Andrews,"  Before August I had never flown with Ryanair because of all the awful reviews I'd heard. However, planning a last minute trip to Barcelona with other low cost airlines proved tricky due to flight times so I bit the bullet and booked with Ryanair. I shouldn't have worried as I really couldn't fault the airline. My boyfriend and I flew out of Liverpool to Barcelona and home again, with great ease. Boarding was simple, as we downloaded our boarding passes to our phones (as we always do whenever we fly, so much easier!). We didn't have luggage to check in so can't comment on that but sailed through boarding easily and were delayed slightly before take off (20 mins or so) once on the plane but it's August summer holidays so to be expected! Staff were all super friendly and very quick coming round with the food and drinks trolley. Yes the food and drinks are expensive in general, and in comparison to other airlines. However, if you have a massive problem with the prices they charge then bring your own food on or just wait until you reach the airport at the other end to eat. Seats are not super comfortable or luxurious but they're decent enough for a short haul flight, and you get what you pay for.

The on board crew were actually very nice and it was a training flight with additional cabin crew members. Purchased three new ""breakfast burrito"" on board and in fairness it was lovely, aircraft was ""well worn"" and not the cleanest but short hop it was fine.

Crew were great under a very good cabin supervisor who was Polish and I felt sorry for him as people would not take their seats. A lot of angry passengers from what I heard with what appears to be the policy of people getting separated under the automatic seat selection process, but if you area paying a low fare why not pay the the extra £4 or £5 to sit together? It's not the end of the world. Cabin service was good, they went around plenty of times with the trolley, as this was Agadir they were also selling alchohol at very reasonable prices.

On the outbound flight I arrived 2 hour and 10 mins early and queued in line (after checking in online the day before) to check my bag. They had only a few members of staff and failed to book us all onto the flight because of lack of staff. I missed my flight. I then had to queue in the customer service line for 2 hours and the response was awful. I was told I had to pay another £100 to be reboarded three days later. Apparently it was mine and my fellow stranded passengers fault we missed the plane (the plane that left half empty, according to my colleagues who were onboard who didn't have to check the company gear). I had to find and pay for another flight to join my colleagues online for the conference (for which, you will recall, I had the gear). Oh and did I mention that they lost my passport at the outset when they randomly checked it. My return flight was no better even with priority booking (oh yes, don't be fooled that means nothing!) they took my hand luggage away because the flight was full, meaning I couldn't do my work and then the flight was delayed by an hour and 20 mins.

We checked in a day before the flight and it turned out that although we had our seats assigned in two diffrent parts of the airplane, we were seated in extra legroom seats (1, 2 and 16 row) and that was a pleasant surprise. I really despise the Ryanair’s boardnig procedure – the gate opens before even the airplane finishes its previous rotation. It causes a necessity of waiting in the bus which drives you to the aircraft for a long time (up to 15 mins even on a domestic flight). The cabin was not fresh but despite that, it was quite clean. The flight was smooth and everything went without delay. The thing that made me uncomfortable onboard was the air in the cabin – it smelled as if it was really polluted which made me difficult to breathe. What is more, it seemed like the cabin crew‘s only duty was to sell food/scratchcards/duty free products to the ‘customers‘. They didn’t really care about passenger safety and comfort (some safety announcements were only made in Polish). To conclude, I really appreciate the effort, Ryanair puts in providing low fares and on-time flights but still, they should improve some parts of their service.",Economy Class,y,2017-08-19,wroclaw warsaw flight experience overall quite good checked day flight turned although seat assigned two diffrent part airplane seated extra legroom seat row pleasant surprise really despise ryanair boardnig procedure gate open even airplane finish previous rotation cause necessity waiting bus drive aircraft long time min even domestic flight cabin fresh despite quite clean flight smooth everything went without delay thing made uncomfortable onboard air cabin smelled really polluted made difficult breathe seemed like cabin crew duty sell food scratchcards duty free product customer really care passenger safety comfort safety announcement made polish conclude really appreciate effort ryanair put providing low fare time flight still improve part service,0.9606,Positive,761

1059,P Carney,"  My longest Ryanair sector so far, considering I have flown many times with them before. If you play by the rules, and do as they say you get a cheap flight that's usually comfortable and on time. Using Stansted for this, the gate was far away from the terminal which is fine. Having bought priority boarding, I was one of the first to board but somehow that doesn't matter, just be at the front of the regular queue and you'll save a few quid in the process. Only 90 carry on's can be placed in the overhead locker so I asked for mine to be placed in the hold, gate staff are more often than not happy to assist in that matter when they are asked. Bag tag goes on and I left my suitcase with a baggage handler. Onboard the aircraft was with the old Ryanair cabin on one of their oldest Boeing 737-800 although, she didn't look it. The majority of the Ryanair fleet have the older, more padded seats in a 189Y configuration so good if you're a little larger, like myself. The newer in the fleet with the Boeing Sky Interior have the lighter-weight seating which has far less padding but more legspace although I cannot vouch for that. The seat was comfortable and legspace was okay although another inch would of been beneficial for all 6"" of me. Crew attentive as always passing through the cabin twice on this three hour flight providing a refreshments service which I find to be overpriced so buy before hand in the airport where you'll save money. Crew also passed through the cabin with some perfumes, electronic items and the famous Ryanair scratchcard. Onboard was rather warm but the flight was near enough full so that's to be expected. A comfortable crossing. A smooth landing into Sofia and we parked on a remote stand. Bussed to the terminal on a sweltering old bus into Terminal 2, the better of the two terminals. Ryanair being one of the few low cost carriers to use Terminal 2. Passport control was smooth with border police just visually checking my passport while there was a short delay with getting my bag on the carousel. Returning was a similar affair. The gate staff at Sofia look for oversize bags at the gate so please be warned in carrying oversized bags not to the restrictions. They were also checking for oversized second carry on bags too. I asked for my suitcase to be placed in the hold which the obliged. The flight was delayed 40 minutes due to a delay with the inbound aircraft; something that does happen from time to time with the last flights of the day with Ryanair. I slept for most of the flight home onboard a full flight. Air-conditioning was on although it was rather warm onboard and I slept comfortably for such a small space. A quick left hand turn onto short finals ensured a smooth landing into London Stansted. Parked on a remote stand again and was bussed on an old London bendy bus to the terminal where my bag was waiting on the carousel.

1060,Christopher Rainbow,  This was a very early morning flight from Madrid to Toulouse. I was able to check-in online and found the bag-drop to be efficient and reasonably quick too. There was quite a long wait at the departure gate and this is where things were poorly managed. Boarding was not well organised at all. The cabin crew were welcoming and undertook the safety demonstration in a professional manner. I found the crew to be hardworking and very approachable. The flight left on time and arrived promptly. The interior of the flight was clean and rather spartan.

After 45 minutes the captain said that the drinks trolley would be coming round if anyone wanted to buy a drink. The plane was very hot and staff unhelpful.

We were so far apart from each other we couldn't see any other member of our family, even though my children are not yet 18. They are deliberately splitting people up if they refuse to pay the extra to choose seats. So if you leave it to chance you will be guaranteed to sit apart.

1071,David Curran,"  We fly a lot. We have flown with the best, Etihad, Cathay, Singapore Airlines, Emirates etc. We have also flown with many budget airlines around the world. We can now say we have flown with what must be, the worst airline on earth. We were in the middle of a cruise with no internet. We docked at Ibiza and went for a coffee. Whilst there we got internet access and received an email from Ryanair saying if we didn't check in, we could be charged $50 Euro each. To our disbelif, we tried to check in online but at the final stage, we were kicked out of the website. We tried several times. At that time there was a global virus effecting everywhere and our search engine Google was not allowing us to access many websites. We were in the Ryanair website but could not complete the check-in. We eventually gave up and decided to try later. Our next stop was Palma where we departed the ship. As we did not have internet access, we decided to get to the airport early so we could hopefully complete check-in well before the 2 hour window Ryanair gives. We arrived at Palma airport 2 hours and 40 minutes before our flight. We waiting in the check-in queue for around 25 minutes. When we finally were called we explained to the check-in lady that we could not check-in as their website wold not let us complete the checkin the day before. She then went out of her way to try and check us in on our mobile phone. She gave us the thumbs up, but then she must have had the same problem. She tried again but could not check us in on our phone. With 8 minutes before the the 2 hour window, she gave up and said sorry you have 8 minutes good luck. We tried but could not check in on time. Then we went back to the check-in counter and the lady gave us a docket to go to the service counter to pay the $100 Euro ($50 x 2). We walked to the service counter and stood in line for another 15 minutes. We paid $100 Euro because we had no option. When we originally booked this flight, we had other options and wow didn't we regret flying this airline. Whilst waiting in the check-in queue and the service counter queue we heard complaint after complaint about the service/procedures. When we boarded the plane, we saw the seats and could not believe our eyes. The tightest seating I have ever seen, including all the Asian airlines. Scattered crumbs, loose hair and rubbish on just about every seat. I brushed the food off our seat and then thought to take a photo. I wished I took the photo before? When you view the seat photo, the yellow is the head rest of the seat in front. This will show how tight the seats are. The plane looked dirty. As we sat down we heard a lady with a British accent discuss the lack of baggage storage. She had a small bag. The Ryanair stewardess said ""bad luck, take your seat"". The lady passenger yelled ""Typical Ryanair"" The photos attached show the condition of the plane. The seating stunk, worn leather. So on top of an extra $100 Euro we flew the longest hour of our lives and were counting the seconds to get off. Thankfully there were no more dramas after we landed. Do not fly this airline. The response from Ryanair was a standard reply and we could tell they did not read our email.

1072,W Salter,"  Memmingen to Dublin. My boyfriend bought me 200 euros worth of Ryanair flight vouchers for my birthday last year. When I tried to use them to purchase a flight, they wouldn't work. I spent hours and a couple of days with customer service trying to get them to work. Over time, flight prices go up, and they were not offering any solutions. They kept blaming my browser, although I had tried it on various computers, phones, and browsers. Ryanair refused to refund the gift vouchers that didn't work and they refused to book the flight for me. Finally, their solution was for me to purchase the flight with my own debit card and then they would refund the money. I did this, and I did not receive a refund until a month later after having to contact them multiple times to get the refund. In the end they did not refund the full price paid with my debit card. The flight I purchased was less than the balance on my gift vouchers, so I should have gotten new vouchers with the remaining balance according to the terms of the gift vouchers. But, the gift vouchers expired during the time it took them to refund my money, so I guess that money is just lost. I have filed a another claim to try to request the full amount be refunded to my debit card and to receive the remaining balance on new gift vouchers, but after the experience I have had with them, I do not expect to ever see it.

1073,B Reeve,"  Berlin to Stansted. We purchased Ryan Air tickets for this leg of our flight because they had the best price. We bought the tickets several months in advance. Forty-eight hours before the flight I got an email saying that we had to pre-check-in to avoid a 50 Euro additional charge. I used my cell phone to go online and do this, but when I got to the website I went as far as I could with the pre-check-in and thought it was done. I clicked on every button that seemed to advance me to the next part and then came to the end. When we got in line to check in we were told to go to another line where we learned that the pre-check-in never went through, so we had to pay an additional 50 Euros for each ticket. There were also others in the same line who had the same experience. When we finished the trip I wrote to Ryan Air about it and got back a curt letter saying there was nothing wrong with their website, and that they would not reimburse us.

It was a newish plane with comfortable seating not reserved and reasonable legroom for a six footer +. Staf were friendly and not at all pushy as I had been led to believe. In all a pleasurable flight. Return however was different as it was an older type plane and although we had prepaid for seats on the return leg, they were extremely cramped and uncomfortable. They reminded me of the old ""cattle class"" seats when airlines didn't consider the customers just got as many on board as possible. I couldn't put the tray table down level as it was balanced on my chest! Staff were good again and friendly.

1085,W Mitchell,"  Have flown with Ryanair a few times at this stage and from now onwards will try to avoid them at all costs as they are probably the worst airline after United. They come across as a low cost airline but they make up for it in as many ways as possible. If you want checked baggage it is an addition a fee of approx €35 each way for a 15kg bag! If you don't have a boarding pass before arriving to the airport they will charge €50 to print each one and their latest trick is to try and get people to pay for their desired seat allocation. If you don't want to pay for your seat allocation they will purposely split you up, myself and my partner were about 10 rows apart on our way to Palermo and back from Dublin. We know there were many others in the same situation including families with children. On my return flight I even had a free seat next to me. Seats don't recline on the planes and there are zero complimentary refreshments including basics like water.

1088,B Wilson,"  Over thirty minutes late leaving Poitiers, but arrived at Stansted only a few minutes behind schedule. Pretty scruffy aircraft, obviously the late arrival in Poitiers left insufficient time for a thorough clean. Aisle seats are not great given the constant movement of trolleys and the inevitable knocks to arms and legs. Random Seat Allocation - This term is somewhat of a misnomer. The only way it is random is that if you don’t pay to select a seat before travel you will certainly be allocated seats away from others on your booking. BA despite their recent demise usually have the sense to allocate passengers on the same booking adjacent seats. On this flight we were seated just 15 rows apart. From the comments of other passengers and on social media, this really must be considered an ‘own goal’ by the airline. Surely it would be better to increase lead in prices a little and get rid of this ridiculous policy and stop antagonising numerous passengers. Until the last couple of months I had been increasingly impressed by Ryanair’s more customer focussed attempts. In future I will travel with another carrier wherever possible. Hopefully, the ‘bean counters’ at the airline will revert this ridiculous policy

1089,Paul Tricki,"  Flew from Edinburgh to Vigo. Ryanair were responsible for my wife and I being separated, they tried to hold our seats to ransom unless we paid £20 extra (each way) for allocated seating which we refused on principle. As a consequence we were allocated random seats. The craziest thing is my wife found herself sitting in the middle seat between a husband and wife who were also allocated random seat numbers. Anyway, we got our revenge by frequently wandering up and down the plane to speak, thereby causing delays to the cabin trolley service. I suggest others should do likewise until this policy is binned.

1090,T Kemp,"  Absolutely awful experience flying with Ryanair from Mykonos to Athens. My friend and I made sure to buy 2 x 15kg luggage allowance each because we knew the charges would be exorbitant otherwise. Imagine our fury when the lady at the check-in counter insisted that ""it wasn't reflected in the system"", and tried to make us pay an additional €62 to check our extra bag, even after we showed her our e-receipt, booking confirmation and boarding passes. She spoke to us as if we were stupid and just kept repeating ""1 each,"" even though we had already explained multiple times! Seems ridiculous that the system could generate my documents with accurate information but couldn't do the same for hers? It reeks of a huge scam to get customers to pay more, even if they've already paid for extra baggage allowance. Boarding at the gate was entirely disorganised and messy, and the staff kept forcing passengers to prove that their carry on luggage was within the restricted size, only to tell them that their bags would have to be checked because the cabin was full. The staff in general were extremely rude and kept yelling at people to get out of the business class waiting area, even though there weren't any signs properly demarcating the place. To top it all off, the flight was half an hour late.

Me and my sister paid for allocated seating going and coming back from Bristol to Malaga which cost us £20 in total, which we didn't mind because we knew we'd be sat next to each other. Once we sat down we found it quite disrespectful to see passengers moving their loved ones next to the empty seats next to them and the crew allowing them to do so, and it wasn't just the one it was several. The flight finally departed and we was in the air ten minutes in a cabin crew member came up to us and asked if we would be separated for the flight for a lady that wasn't very well, when I explained that we had paid for these seats and many others hadn't but moved her response was roll of the eyes and stormed off.

After waiting in the check in line for 20+ minutes, the agent informed us we would have to pay a fee of fifty (50) euros each - just to check in for the flight, in addition to the fee for the flight which we had already paid. Along with some 40 or more other passengers, we all had to go to a different location, wait in line again and pay the fee, in addition to 35 euros each for our checked bag - a total of 85 euros each which was in addition to the cost of the flight.

It's irritating how Ryanair keeps pushing you to buy a seat 'or maybe you won't sit together'. On the outbound flight the computer put as together at an A and B-seat but on our way back we were punished for not buying our seats: my wife and I were seperated about 15 rows and put both in a B-seat. Why is a mystery since there were enough seats next to each other and the cabin crew allowed me to join my wife. I would suggest that Ryanair stops this mocking of passengers.

1097,L Bremner,"  Stansted to Poitiers. Boarding at Stansted was somewhat shambolic. After queuing at the gate, we were then left standing on the tarmac for about twenty minutes before actually getting on the aircraft. Ryanair’s recent charm offensive seems to have gone in reverse given the way seats are arbitrarily allocated at check in, unless you pay to choose your own. My wife and I were given middle seats in two different rows whilst both the seats adjacent to us were unoccupied. Bizarre!! This situation seemed to apply to many other families resulting in a shambles as many passengers attempted to swop seats in an attempt to sit together. Departure was thirty minutes late, but because of the generous flight times the plane landed in Poitiers just 15 minutes behind schedule.

1098,D Woodall," I booked tickets from Stansted to Valencia for me and my partner at the same time. The latest money grabbing trick by Ryanair is to seat a couple at the furthest ends of the plane from each other, even when the plane has 90% empty seats, so that if you want to sit together you have to pay to allocate a seat - I have got to say I have been waiting years for them to work this one out - so predictable. This now goes beyond cheeky and is into the realm of despicable behaviour. Seats have always been filled on a first come, first served basis until now, so it is clear that this is done on purpose so as to generate more profit. But do you know what? This profit is not going to be coming from me, as I vow never to fly Ryanair again. I am a very regular flyer who tends to sway towards budget airlines, so EasyJet will be seeing much more business from me in future (unless they try the same filthy trick as Ryanair).

1116,L Raynor,"  I've had bad experiences with Ryanair before, as it's just part of travelling economy with them most of the time. I purchased a flight that I immediately tried to check in on. However, I found I'd lost my passport. That's fine, I'd only booked the ticket 20 mins ago, so thought it would be reasonable to get a refund. They don't give one. So I want to change my flight, that's okay within 24 hours. There's a £5 charge anyway, but that's okay. Except that Ryanair won't allow you to upgrade the next flight to match to price of your existing one, forcing you to undercut your ticket price and lose money. Ryanair don't refund this money back to you, won't allow you to use this money as credit on other flights or services and don't allow you to add options to your new flight, like additional baggage, ect. The customer service advisers I spoke to were awful, none of them made any suggestions or offered help, but continually spammed the same response about terms and conditions over and over. So I find that I can fly to Ireland without a Passport anyway, since I'm flying from the UK. I can use my driving license. Except you can't with Ryanair. You can with other airlines, but not Ryanair.

1118,Ralph Jones,  Another well priced efficient trip on Ryanair. They have a well defined product and very little is at fault.

1120,Tom Edmunds,  Ryanair provided exactly what I was expecting for the price paid flying from London to Cologne. Check in was fine as this is done via their app but boarding was late as always and the ground staff predictable indifferent. Once on board the seats were bearable with only a small amount of leg room. If I were over 6ft then it would be uncomfortable. Cabin crew are okay but spend the most part finding places for people's bags as they continually fail to impose size or weight restriction at the gate given the bags people bring on board. The flight was late arriving but nothing to severe and disembarking was a breeze with front ant back doors used.

1122,C Bennett,"  Flew from Glasgow Prestwick to Lanzarote. I have not flown with Ryanair for some years as my last experience was so poor. I was, therefore, pleased to find that both the flight and staff attitude had improved considerably. I also felt that the policy of trying to sell you food, drink and lottery tickets on every minute of the flight had been changed. You are limited on leg space but that is true of all budget airlines. The plane could have done with a more thorough clean between flights. I paid for speedy boarding and that made a big difference as I avoided the usual crush and was able to take hand luggage on board without worrying that it would need to be put in the hold.

After boarding the plane at approximately 6.45am, my wife and i both noticed that some of the passengers had brought onboard their own cans of beer and were starting to drink even before we took off. Throughout the flight the cabin staff were serving them alchohol even up to about half an hour before landing.

Not so much bag drop as bag wait around, faff about with printing your own luggage labels, whilst in a busy confined area trying to manage 3 children. Very stressful.

1128,S Jensen,"  Dublin to Amsterdam. Absolutely terrible experience. After being told to queue for boarding (while the plane was nowhere in sight), we had to stand for almost an hour before the plane arrived and we could board. After the door eventually closed (45 minutes after our scheduled takeoff) the pilot informed us we missed our takeoff slot and had to sit on the plane for near 2 hours before we could get another one. There were various other annoyances (not enough space for carry-ons, gate information not available until right before boarding was supposed to begin, etc). The overall experience was nightmarish and inconvenienced a plane full of eager vacationers. The lower ticket prices make sense now, and I strongly urge you to pay a little extra to avoid a similar experience.",Economy Class,n,2017-02-23,dublin amsterdam absolutely terrible experience told queue boarding plane nowhere sight stand almost hour plane arrived could board door eventually closed minute scheduled takeoff pilot informed u missed takeoff slot sit plane near hour could get another one various annoyance enough space carry ons gate information available right boarding supposed begin etc overall experience nightmarish inconvenienced plane full eager vacationer lower ticket price make sense strongly urge pay little extra avoid similar experience,-0.7792,Negative,520

1130,Roy Carpenter,"  Flew Ryanair from Faro to London Stansted. Using 'Special Assistance' I found the cabin staff on both flights, as usual, very helpful. Outbound was a new 737-800 with the thinner seats and modified wing form which gave slightly more leg room and a quieter flight. An interesting phenomenon of the new wing form was that the vapour trail formed much nearer the trailing edge and was observable from row 28. Outbound was on time but return was delayed 30 minutes due to a combination of Stansted passenger delays and a strong head wind giving a rather lumpy ride on an older aircraft. One thing Ryanair have got right is their choice of red wine which for me is the best of all the low cost airlines.",Economy Class,y,2017-02-14,flew ryanair faro london stansted using special assistance found cabin staff flight usual helpful outbound new thinner seat modified wing form gave slightly leg room quieter flight interesting phenomenon new wing form vapour trail formed much nearer trailing edge observable row outbound time return delayed minute due combination stansted passenger delay strong head wind giving rather lumpy ride older aircraft one thing ryanair got right choice red wine best low cost airline,0.9153,Positive,478
1131,Stepan Hrobar,"  Porto to Barcelona. Another great flight with Ryanair. Departing from Porto is very pleasant as Ryanair uses a big hall in the groud floor from which people just walk to the aircraft and board using both front and rear door, this is somehow very convenient (unless the weather is poor). Our plane was new with their modified slimline seats, which, compared to the older type, improve legroom rapidly and with 185 cm, I felt comfortable. Also the cabin colors on their newer planes are not as agressive as it used to be a couple of years ago, a big improvement. Can't wait to be lucky enough to try the SkyInterior on a Ryanair flight. We arrived on time, the cabin crew was very nice and the flight was cheap, as always.",Economy Class,y,2017-02-13,porto barcelona another great flight ryanair departing porto pleasant ryanair us big hall groud floor people walk aircraft board using front rear door somehow convenient unless weather poor plane new modified slimline seat compared older type improve legroom rapidly cm felt comfortable also cabin color newer plane agressive used couple year ago big improvement wait lucky enough try skyinterior ryanair flight arrived time cabin crew nice flight cheap always,0.959,Positive,460
1132,F Gibson,"  I travelled Edinburgh to Barcelona on Feb 3rd 2017 returning on Feb 7th 2017. The outbound flight was early in the day however was ideal as you got an extra day in Barcelona. Return flight again was ideal, as you got home at a reasonable time. I booked extra leg room seats, 2D was my seat for both flights. With that you got priority boarding. Extra legroom was excellent, I'm 5'11 with back problems and I found this seat comfy and could straighten my leg out full with passengers who sit in 2D/E can get past me without hassling me. So I recommend anyone flying with RyanAir to do this! I would like a bit more cushion for your bottom. Priority boarding is good, as you don't wait in the normal queue, however its annoying when you are boarded first, and everyone is trying to get past you to get to their seat, and are hitting you with their bags etc. However great for you when you land, you are off first. One thing on the baggage, is on the Ryanair website they sound like they are strict with the baggage allowance. I noticed many people having 'bigger' bags getting on the plane okay, no questions asked. Thought that was a bit unfair considering I had cabin bag size. Mobile boarding, love it!  However I would like Ryanair to do what easyJet do, and alert you of the gate via your phone. Anyway, I would fly again with Ryanair, always on time, never late, cheap, and very good!!

1135,Sergio Da Palma,"  Ponta Delgada to Lisbon. There are many factors that contribute to a satisfactory journey and unfortunately not all the expectancies were met for this flight. Let's start with the positive side and then see what was wrong and could be improved. The value for money was great, just 15 euros for a 2-hour-flight. I would never had booked this journey without getting a similar fare. It makes all the difference. Now it's time to see what could be improved. Ground handling: below the standards. The incoming flight was delayed, so they decided to start boarding when the plane arrived at the stand. That added more delay and resulted in a slot loss and in a 30-minute-delayed departure, that could problably had been partially avoided with a better coordination. The flight time was shorter than scheduled, so that we catched up the delay and we arrived just 5 minutes behind schedule. The onboard experience was good and being asked to move to a vacant seat in the emergency exit row gave some rest to my long legs. Awesome, isn't it? Negative score to the bar service: the food products we selected were unavailable and that was a pity. I don't mind having a snack or to dine on board instead of doing it at the airport, but with no guarantees about the products available, I'll start to consider the airport bars when flying with Ryanair.

I do find travelling longer distances can feel a little cramped, which yesterday was definitely the case - it was a very full flight and I felt claustrophobic at the window seat with my bag at my feet, coat on my lap, and two female passengers to my right. Usually I get over the claustrophobic feeling, but this time the heating on the plane was very over-powering and it got so warm I started to feel sick, dizzy and faint. The cabin staff and the head air hostess on duty were professional and had a rapid response to me which I am so grateful for. If it wasn't for them, I would have passed out or thrown up, or both. They removed people immediately from my row so I could lie down and elevate my legs. I was offered tea and sugar and a member of the cabin staff sat with me until the colour came back into my face and I felt normal again.

1145,Roddy MacDonald,"  Edinburgh to Faro. Checked in online, so upon arrival at the airport proceeded straight to the gate to find that just under half the flight had also purchased priority boarding so that pretty much defeats the point of the perk! We were then made to queue outside for 20 minutes until the aircraft was ready - bearing in mind it's January and we're in Scotland, it was freezing. Once I boarded the aircraft one of the flight attendants commented on how cold my hands were which was bizarre as the only reason I was that cold was due to the airline that they were representing. The flight also almost ran out of food and they flight attendants couldn't of cared less, it felt like they just wanted to finish their shift and get home. We missed our departure slot at Edinburgh which was slightly frustrating as we were standing in the cold outside the aircraft for so long - but the informative Captain got us there only 5 minutes later than scheduled!

Faro to Bristol the cabin staff not only ensured we were comfortable but placed our cabin bag in the locker and removed it on landing, and also insisted on carrying it out to the lift for us and wishing us Seasons Greetings. On our return from East Midlands we were late following car problems, went to the un-manned special assistance desk and after a delay were told we only had 20 minutes before the gate closed and to go direct to security. We were then turned back and told we had to check in our case at the Ryanair check-in about 200 yds away. We got there with 3 minutes before the gate closed and the lovely lady there checked our case, told us not worry and went off to give the EMA staff an ear-bashing.

I have a nut allergy and according to sources on the internet the best thing to do (given Ryanairs limited advice on it) is to inform the cabin crew upon arrival.

1149,Toni Pozo," I'm pretty amazed by the positive comments for Ryanair. I was flying with them last week from Malaga to Palma de Mallorca, after many years avoiding them. I'm not criticizing this company, but it is obvious that is a low cost company without any kind of comfort for the customer. I have experienced long lines in order to access the plane and have a place to store your luggage - it doesn't matter if you have assigned seat. Passengers have to stand more than 45 minutes before the call to board, and even after this they made us to wait other 30 minutes before entry to the plane. Once inside there is a big rush of people trying to put their luggage in rack without any consideration for the next passenger. Staff quite overtaken by this and during the flight only bother to sell food, drinks, lottery tickets and perfume. Our flight had 1 hour delay. Seats are quite uncomfortable.

I made the mistake of booking 3 trips with this airline. 2 of my trips were canceled by the airline, leaving me stranded in Paris and Greece with no help at all and leaving me with a bill of $450 that they would not reimburse. The one trip from Dublin to Copenhagen that I did make it to my destination on, we were delayed by over 1 1/2 hours. Cabin crew were rude. I have nothing good to say about Ryanair and will never fly with them again, no matter how cheap their prices are.

However, we both got surprised on how smooth and painless everything went. Since I work as a travel agent I knew of all the ""hidden"" fees and everything you need to do prior to your arrival at the airport, so check-in etc went very smooth. We chose to purchase the priority boarding queue which turned out to be totally worth it, we had lots of room while we were in line since most people used the regular line, which was very comfortable. We boarded a little late, which we we prepared for so no harm there and once we got on the aircraft the cabin crew were very friendly and even funny. The security briefing went by very fast though.

1154,William Jackson,"We flew Valencia to Bergamo and then Bergamo to Athens and back. All flights were on time with professional and friendly service both on the ground and in the air apart from the ground service in Athens. I usually pay for priority boarding because it guarantees I keep my hand luggage on board and above my seat which means a quicker and easier exit from the plane. Boarding in Athens was chaos. A passenger asked why the priority boarding procedure was not being followed and the reply from the ground staff was: ""nobody understands how it works"". Meanwhile at the next gate, the correct boarding procedure was followed without a hitch. On our return I wrote to Ryanair just to let them know what had happened and explained that I knew it was not their fault, but was the fault of the handling agents in Athens, I received an immediate reply advising that the extra I had paid for priority boarding would be refunded to me.

1157,T Emerson," I have flown with Ryanair very often over the last few months from Edinburgh and Glasgow down to London. The aircraft are clean. The flights are on time and the prices are ridiculously cheap. You can get Edinburgh to London single from £9.99 if you book early. I find the staff on board tend to be very pleasant and helpful. The seat is fine, it is certainly not the most comfortable ever but given that they only do short flights this is fine. The only slight annoyance is that there is no seatback pocket to put anything in. Overall I would recommend them highly, I think that the value is much better than BA. Ryanair do not charge for a credit card payment, BA charge £5. Ryanair are more frequently on time in my experience, and the prices are often around 1/8 of BA prices. No contest I would choose Ryanair. Stansted as an airport is fine, the security was better before they meddled with it, the staff can be rude, but this is the same for anywhere, the main problem is that other passengers at Stansted are just awful, but once you've been a few times you find the quiet seating areas away from everyone else. Ryanair is a good experience, especially for the price. To sum up it does what it says on the tin. To those reviewers complaining about being charges to check in, this is commonplace now, read the instructions before you book and you'll be fine, its not Ryanair's fault.",Economy Class,y,2016-12-03,flown ryanair often last month edinburgh glasgow london aircraft clean flight time price ridiculously cheap get edinburgh london single book early find staff board tend pleasant helpful seat fine certainly comfortable ever given short flight fine slight annoyance seatback pocket put anything overall would recommend highly think value much better ba ryanair charge credit card payment ba charge ryanair frequently time experience price often around ba price contest would choose ryanair stansted airport fine security better meddled staff rude anywhere main problem passenger stansted awful time find quiet seating area away everyone else ryanair good experience especially price sum say tin reviewer complaining charge check commonplace read instruction book fine ryanair fault,0.9637,Positive,779
1158,M Maguire,"  Manchester to Alicante return. The outward flight was punctual and I had an empty seat beside me - always useful as you can twist sideways and gain a little extra comfort. The inflight service was poor. As seats on Ryanair do not have pockets, the price list in contained in their magazine. On this occasion, none was offered. Instead, cabin crew simply started selling. I asked for the list and was astonished to find the prices expressed in euros. When I questioned this, the steward told me that this was because Ryanair was an Irish airline. When I asked what the conversion rate to sterling was, I was told it was roughly the same. Crews are now equipped with handheld calculators. I was 'allowed' to pay in sterling, but, when I asked what the exchange rate was, was simply told 'Ryanair's own'. So, to sum up: lack of transparent/any visible pricing, exorbitant on-board prices - and not even a half-melted ice cube in sight! Why can't the CAA set some basic standards and sort Ryanair out once and for all? We know the fares are cheap, but that shouldn't be an excuse for trying to bamboozle people. And certainly a price cap is needed for printing boarding passes at the airport. The flight back was in complete contrast: well-dressed cabin crew, girls made up immaculately, good piloting and on-time landing. Needless to say, this time I didn't try to buy anything on board.

Quick check-in, possibility of having e-boarding pass (much more useful when you don't have a printer) - 10/10. What always happens fir me with Ryanair in Stansted is delays. On my most recent flight with Ryanair everything was perfectly on time. Boarding was quick, no problems. I was sitting at the front of aircraft - seat 07C - first from the aisle. I would never ever do that again. I would rather pay extra money to sit next to the window than 50 cm away from nonstop walking cabin staff.

However, I decided to try them when I found a very low price to my destination, and also because a friend told me they'd improved their customer services considerably. The on-line booking and purchase were simple and straight forward. I received several follow-up e-mails reminding of any additional services I might like to add. Check-in at Berlin Schoenefeld was fast and there was no line. Boarding on-time. Although my carry-on day pack was probably a bit larger and heavier than the rules permit, no one looked at my hand luggage or hassled me about it. I had paid for priority boarding, which worked well. There was separate priority line and we were allowed to board first. The plane was clean, the seat reasonably comfortable, and the service was friendly and efficient. I noticed none of the excessive announcements or heavy selling that I'd read about.

I have to give a thumbs up for the ground crew, the flight was delayed for about 1h and they came and told everybody and apologised for it personally and not simply with an announcement, a lot of traditional flag carriers should learn from this. Boarding was fast and we departed late but not as late as we were expecting. The airplane was clean. The crew was very friendly, smiling all the time. Not sure if this happens every time but whenever I travel in the last flight of the day with Ryanair, the crew seems to be much more friendly and playful, with a light mood and doing some nice jokes to cheer the passengers. On board sales service was well provided and prices were affordable. Once again, the crew was very effective and helpful with passengers buying items as I did. Flight was very quiet, with zero turbulence (which is rare in a flight to the Azores) and although we arrived with a delay, we manage to recover some of that 1h delay, arriving with something like 30 to 40 minutes late.

As I am about 1.90 m tall, legroom is very important for me and I felt satisfied with my seat, as I had enough space to stretch my legs. The cabin crew were nice,  welcoming and funny, so the flight was pleasant except for the commercial announcements that were very frequent during the journey.

I bought priority boarding, priority security (Fast Track) and priority seat assignments. That made the experience tolerable. However, Stansted Airport was a disaster, and I would never again fly out of there. Add to the unbelievably large Duty Free Area the fact that a gate is not assigned until about 40 minutes prior to departure. That is unforgivable - that leaves scant little time to get to that gate. In our case, the single escalator leading up to the Gate 40-59 waiting area was out of service, so 180 passengers per flight times 19 gates meant over 3400 people were trying to ascend a single staircase. The obvious fire-hazard aside, it meant a crush of humanity in the passageway and an exceptionally long transit time from the hub to the gate. The only reason I can see for this is to keep the passengers in the shopping/dining area as long as possible. Rome Ciampino, on the other hand, is a dump, but quickly navigated.

1182,Carl Queiros,"London Stansted to Tallinn with Ryanair. Absolutely one of the worst airlines on the planet. Don't be fooled by the initial cheap fares. They add charges for everything: printing your ticket, baggage check-in, meals, drinks, choosing your seat etc. Traveling around I did not have access to a printer. At the airport they charged me 15 Euro just to print the boarding pass, which I had to do myself. So that is charging me 15 Euro for me to touch their screen a few times and use a small piece of their paper? This, and everything else, is pure extortion. Even on the flight you are constantly harassed to buy things. There is no doubt that you are seen as a money-making opportunity and not as a person or valued client. The crew are friendly, but not the ground staff and their system is cumbersome and disorganised. I vow never to fly Ryanair again.

Interestingly when we raised the issue of the foul smell with a different member of crew, on leaving the plane we were told that we had been offered a move and that there was a limited amount they could do to clean up vomit so despite the initial denial of knowledge the crew were well aware of the unpleasant conditions in which we had been expected to travel.

1192,Donnie Macleod,"First time on Ryanair for at least ten years and it took the availability of direct flights to the north of Spain to attract us back. We took the business plus option and, while more expensive, it was certainly cheaper than any other option on any route to the same area. We were certainly happy with the service through Edinburgh airport, although there didn't appear to be a dedicated business plus desk available, but the fast track through security and the early boarding were very welcome. Flight departure was scheduled for 6.55am and by 6.25 we were standing outside the airport buildings at the head of a long queue waiting for boarding. This is probably the worst part of flying with Ryanair and such as passengers may be exposed to the elements for quite some time waiting to board, thankfully on this particular morning it was dry, not too cold and bearable. The crew appeared about 6.30 and by 6.40 we were in our seats watching the oncoming passengers in what appeared to be a full load struggling to find overhead locker space and, some their seats. Departure was delayed by half an hour for air traffic control purposes but, once airborne everything went very smoothly and I managed to catch up with some sleep on the way. Cabin crew were friendly, informative and appeared to meet all the needs expected of them by passengers. The return trip was somewhat similar although check-in in Santander was through normal processes, i.e. we all queued up for two desks and took our turn with everybody else to check-in our bags, there was no special service for business plus but that was not a problem as the staff at the desks were quite efficient. Again, the wait outside for boarding, this time in nice sunshine, aboard in plenty of time and airborne exactly on schedule. A newer aircraft this time with the more modern Boeing cabin lighting etc. Good service from the crew and this time we availed ourselves of the excellent coffee and a croissant at an acceptable price.

No apology, no explanation, nothing. Some 30 minutes later we were boarded onto a different plane which stood on the tarmac for at least another 45 minutes waiting for refueling.

1203,John Underwood,"Cork to Stansted. Regular traveller with Ryanair, not so much by choice but they are only airline going to Stansted which is near where I work. I have found nothing different about Ryanair since their effort to be more friendly according to their ads. The staff on the plane are generally unhelpful and unfriendly, the staff on the ground are the same and you can add ""look disinterested"". I have been a regular traveller for 18 years and I will try to be impartial so I must say they are generally on time. Apart from that one fact which is important they are a disaster as a service and god help you if anything goes wrong ie lose your ticket, passport etc or have a query. You will be referred to the website by the person on the ground and when you get on there you can talk to an agent on their webchat. I have done this a number of times and nothing ever gets resolved, you go round and round in circles. I recently had my passport stolen and did not realise this until I got to the airport. I saw the Ryanair help desk and it was like talking to a brick wall - no facial expression, not a care or desire to help. I had my Irish driving licence with photo id and my address on the card, but they said it needs to be a passport which they know I had stolen. I said you can check on my Ryanair account which shows clearly when logged in I had 4 other flights booked in the next 2 months plus the previous 100 taken in last 2 years, again just a sigh and no help. I feel that the staff really do need to be recruited better and trained to help and find a way to express themselves. You do not even need a passort to fly from UK to Ireland so what was the problem? I ended up catching an Aer Lingus flight back from Heathrow to Cork and what a treat that was - a far cry from Ryanair in every detail such a professional outfit.

1207,G White,"Cork to Lanzarote. I am writing a review on behalf of my partially sighted 76 year old mother, who flew alone on flight FR9943 from Cork to Lanzarote on the 8th of Sept. 2016 to meet other family members who were already holidaying there. My mother who also suffers from a chronic back problem can not walk quickly, nor can she walk long distances requested wheelchair assistance and a person to walk her on to the aircraft to find her seat as she is incapable of reading seat numbers due to her sight. All this information is clearly stated on the boarding pass. EASY, SIMPLE, wouldn't you think, not so for Ryanair, my mother was wheeled to the departure gate area and left there. Eventually after a period of time she managed to make her own way to the departure desk to inquire what was going on. The person there literally man handled my mother and ran her down the gangway onto the aircraft dropped her luggage on to a seat and left just as the flight was about to leave. There was not one member of cabin crew helped my mother, other passengers on the flight helped her to find her seat, she put her luggage on the floor as she would be totally unable to put it in the overhead locker. As any traveller would image, a very uncomfortable 4 hour flight with luggage taking up the small space where your feet should be. On arrival at Lanzarote, she and another passenger with need of assistance were left waiting at the exit door of the aircraft for a very long time (I don't know exactly how long but it was certainly long enough for family to start worrying and try to find her, afraid that they had somehow miss her).

1208,Luke Dyson,"Flew Ryanair Manchester to Barcelona return on 4th August and back on 18th August. I had never flown with Ryanair before, and was not expecting much with it being a low-cost airline. Entering the terminal (Manchester T3) we were annoyed to see that Ryanair checks in all their flights at the same counters, and that there was a huge queue, stretching all the way to the cafés nearby. We arrived two hours before the flight and the check in queue took over an hour and obviously we were worried about missing our flight. After getting through check in and security we were running to catch the flight even after being sent to the front of the line in security, thankfully we made it. Upon entering the aircraft (B737-800) I was shocked at how crammed the plane was with seats, the legroom was barely big enough to get to the seat (middle) in the first place, but for a 2 hour flight I could manage. After departure we were handed a magazine with a menu inside. The menu was basic and quite overpriced, but I was hungry so I bought a buttered croissant and a tea (same on the way back) for €3. The flight attendants were kind, attentive and efficient and I received my food very quickly. The food was tasty and the croissant had been warmed. There was a little turbulence on the way, and my tea sloshed a little on me, and the flight attendant quickly helped me clean it up with a smile. After landing in Barcelona we had to wait 25 minutes for our bags to arrive. On the way back to Manchester two weeks later we were cautious and arrived at the airport 2h 30m before the flight instead, but check in and security were very fast and we spent nearly 2 hours in departures, and with big glass windows this was great for me, being an avid plane spotter. The gate was surprisingly in arrivals, and therefore we had to go through security again to get to the plane. After waiting for 20 minutes to board we, along with everyone else were directed towards arrivals, rather than towards the plane, which ended up in a big confusion for the airport staff. Like on the way, the attendants were attentive and kind and although we had major problems with ground staff the airline is very good value for money, and I would recommend it for those who do not have much money to spend on their flight, although if there is a flight with a different airline with a similar price, I'd pick the other.",Economy Class,y,2016-09-21,flew ryanair manchester barcelona return th august back th august never flown ryanair expecting much low cost airline entering terminal manchester annoyed see ryanair check flight counter huge queue stretching way caf nearby arrived two hour flight check queue took hour obviously worried missing flight getting check security running catch flight even sent front line security thankfully made upon entering aircraft b shocked crammed plane seat legroom barely big enough get seat middle first place hour flight could manage departure handed magazine menu inside menu basic quite overpriced hungry bought buttered croissant tea way back flight attendant kind attentive efficient received food quickly food tasty croissant warmed little turbulence way tea sloshed little flight attendant quickly helped clean smile landing barcelona wait minute bag arrive way back manchester two week later cautious arrived airport h flight instead check security fast spent nearly hour departure big glass window great avid plane spotter gate surprisingly arrival therefore go security get plane waiting minute board along everyone else directed towards arrival rather towards plane ended big confusion airport staff like way attendant attentive kind although major problem ground staff airline good value money would recommend much money spend flight although flight different airline similar price pick,0.984,Positive,1388

1216,G Masson,"  Liverpool to Nimes. I'm happy with Ryanair's budget approach, but over many years of using their flights there's been a consistent changing of goal posts that inevitably disadvantages the customer. These do not seem to be writ large all over their website. My latest encounter involved printing boarding passes. I do both the mobile and the printed- belt n braces kind of approach. I was printing the passes from saved pdf files which displayed all images and the barcode perfectly. The boarding passes printed beautifully except for the barcodes. I altered every possible parameter on the printer, even printing as a super-fine image, with the same outcome ie perfect adverts, lovely table for the barcode info, crisp text, but the barcode a grayed-out blur or totally absent. I went online to their 'chat' - 'well i don't know change your printer' : I phoned customer service - 'use a different browser' - nobody else boarding that flight has had this problem so it's your fault'. Being an OCD sort I actually scrutinised the pretty-looking boarding pass I printed. Unlike earlier iterations, the barcode is now a smaller element of a foldable page stacked with big, colourful adverts. Many users may glance at this and not notice that the barcode is wonky or absent. Most customers will now, I guess, be using the mobile app. Which means that it looks like Ryanair have spotted a niche market represented by the digital divide - ie, if you aren't technically aware, and don't own a smartphone, you'll get 'fined' at check-in. Be interesting to see if any other customers have also experienced this. It interests me that in neither of my encounters with customer advice did the operative advise me to use the mobile app instead - which is the logical answer. In both encounters it was the usual Ryanair indifference plus assigning blame to 'stupid customers'.",Economy Class,n,2016-08-29,liverpool nimes happy ryanair budget approach many year using flight consistent changing goal post inevitably disadvantage customer seem writ large website latest encounter involved printing boarding pass mobile printed belt n brace kind approach printing pass saved pdf file displayed image barcode perfectly boarding pass printed beautifully except barcodes altered every possible parameter printer even printing super fine image outcome ie perfect advert lovely table barcode info crisp text barcode grayed blur totally absent went online chat well know change printer phoned customer service use different browser nobody else boarding flight problem fault ocd sort actually scrutinised pretty looking boarding pas printed unlike earlier iteration barcode smaller element foldable page stacked big colourful advert many user may glance notice barcode wonky absent customer guess using mobile app mean look like ryanair spotted niche market represented digital divide ie technically aware smartphone get fined check interesting see customer also experienced interest neither encounter customer advice operative advise use mobile app instead logical answer encounter usual ryanair indifference plus assigning blame stupid customer,0.9839,Positive,1231

But we had 1 hold bag to drop off which we assumed would be a simple bag drop at the airport. We were wrong. We had to queue for an hour to check this bag in as there were only 2 desks checking in all Ryanair flights at the airport. We should not have had to queue at the check in desk to drop a bag when we had already completed our online check in. To our horror, we then had to queue for another hour to drop the bag as the airport doesn't take your bag from the check in desk to the plane on the usual belts (but that's not the airline's fault). There were two further queues at the gate to board the plane. With all the time wasted we had no time left to get our evening meal (we had allowed a generous 3 hours before our flight but it was not enough time). So we were relying on the cabin food once onboard. But they had run out of everything. Only a few pain au chocolat, crisps and coffees were left to share around all passengers onboard.

As we had cabin baggage only I can’t rate ground handling of Ryanair in NUE. The boarding for Ryanair is always efficient. I had to drop my trolley at the aircraft due to full cabin which was a bit annoying. Since you have seats assigned boarding is absolutely comparable to any other airline. Once in the cabin you need to get used to the strong colors. The seats are absolutely sufficient for the 1,5 hours to STN. Announcements had been in clear and understandable English. Take-off was on-time and the flight to STN was absolutely smooth with a safe landing in STN. As usual there is service against charge onboard as well as Duty Free.

1225,J Dean,"Prague to London Stansted with Ryanair. I have flown on this route about 6 times this year and have consistently been very satisfied with Ryanair. There are 3 other budget airlines which I could choose but Ryanair's fares are always the cheapest. They allow a cabin bag plus another small bag (e.g. laptop), which is generous for a budget airline. They boast about a 90% on time arrival (within an hour), and given my experiences I can believe it. I have been delayed once and that was because all flights were grounded due to weather. The staff are fine, friendly enough. Boarding can be a bit chaotic, and I would recommend paying the small fee for priority boarding (note that this does sell out, so do it at time of booking rather than a later add-on). Personally I don't care about in-flight entertainment, magazines, or drink services, so I won't make any judgement based on those (which is good, because they are either non-existent, or average at best). If you want a good trip here is what to bear in mind. Have expectations that match the price - this is a budget airline that tries to deliver best price by having no-frills. Read the rules and stick to them. Cabin bag dimensions are a bit smaller than usual which can catch you out. Only 20cm width as opposed to normal 25cm. Would have caught me out once but fortunately they didn't check bags at the gate. Be sure to check in online prior to arriving at the airport. They do not have check in desks, and if you haven't checked in you are setting yourself up for a hefty penalty. Only the first 90 bags will be boarded, the rest will be put into the hold free of charge. This means that if you insist on carrying your bag, you will have to queue up at the gate to make sure you are one of the earlier passengers to board. If you sit down and wait, go for a coffee or whatever, and then board later, you are not taking your bag on board. The only thing I wish they would change is to remove the bright yellow colour scheme from the cabin. Maybe it's branding, but it just lends a tackiness to the whole experience that seems unnecessary. I am sure they could adjust their brand to something slightly more tasteful. Overall I have to give them top marks. I am not sure they are the best choice for families with small children, but if you're a single traveller or a non-fussy couple/group, and you want to get from A to B cheaply, you won't beat them (on this route, at least).",Economy Class,y,2016-08-13,prague london stansted ryanair flown route time year consistently satisfied ryanair budget airline could choose ryanair fare always cheapest allow cabin bag plus another small bag e g laptop generous budget airline boast time arrival within hour given experience believe delayed flight grounded due weather staff fine friendly enough boarding bit chaotic would recommend paying small fee priority boarding note sell time booking rather later add personally care flight entertainment magazine drink service make judgement based good either non existent average best want good trip bear mind expectation match price budget airline try deliver best price frill read rule stick cabin bag dimension bit smaller usual catch cm width opposed normal cm would caught fortunately check bag gate sure check online prior arriving airport check desk checked setting hefty penalty first bag boarded rest put hold free charge mean insist carrying bag queue gate make sure one earlier passenger board sit wait go coffee whatever board later taking bag board thing wish would change remove bright yellow colour scheme cabin maybe branding lends tackiness whole experience seems unnecessary sure could adjust brand something slightly tasteful overall give top mark sure best choice family small child single traveller non fussy couple group want get b cheaply beat route least,0.9937,Positive,1358

To make the situation worse, the 45 euro / pax penalty was not stated during the purchasing process or on our etickets. After queuing for almost an hour at the check in line of Ryanair,  we were slapped in the face by an impatient check in officer who just rolled her eyes and  said that 'sorry the online check in just ckosed 2mins ago'. And rudely shooed us to the other counter to make payment as she hurried to attend another customer. She said no payment, no boarding, and just shrugged her shoulders. To rub salt in the wound, We were told we could have checked in while waiting in the queue. How would we have known when there was no signage whatsoever while we were queuing. At the 'payment counter' there was another 20 mins queue with more than 30 other passengers paying their penalty. What a great way to easily earn a few thousand extra euro per flight.

1232,G Andrews,"  The plane was very dirty with crumbs/wrapping on seat and floor. I'm sure this is due to the 2 hour delay for boarding and turn around time. Captain made PA-regulation/restrictions would not allow us to push back for 45 minutes (crew laughed at this PA). This seems like more than enough time to clean a plane. Female crew in the aft of the plane giggling through their safety demos, looking behind at the other female crew and making jokes. A lady pressed the call bell and I could see the crew ignoring it and eating crisps instead. What if it's a medical emergency? When she finally came to check she was still chewing. Crew were running through the cabin, with scratch cards laughing at 1am. No hot food, no tea available. The crew found this hilarious and kept laughing when people complained. It took 1 hour+ to get to row 25 with a drinks cart. The crew kept using the call bells during service even though people wanted to sleep. One female crew could not even form a sentence toward the end of the flight. During all her landing PAs she was laughing. She had to stop and start two safety PAs because she could not stop laughing. All the crew were having a fantastic evening. The customers however, after 3 hour delay and terrible customer service were not. Then as we left the plane the crew didn't even look up or smile. We were a total inconvenience.

1233,J Warren,"London Stansted - Bucharest return. Two of my most pleasant flights with Ryanair. It's amazing how much the airline's customer service has improved in recent years, particularly with their allocated seating, extra cabin baggage allowance, use of primary airports and excellent mobile app, features, all of which, have significantly enhanced the overall travel experience. In addition, it is pleasing to see that Ryanair have begun using satellite 2 in Stansted for some of their flights, which offers a far more relaxed boarding experience, along with much more space and seating compared to satellite 3 (which is the main gate area from which Ryanair flights operate). Ryanair should definitely consider making more use of this facility, as it is very underused and often empty for long periods of the day. (In fact, there were only 3 flights operating from there when we flew out). Onboard, I noticed that service has improved too, and there are no longer as many tedious announcements as before, particularly on evening flights. On both flights, cabin crew were very friendly and professional. Clearly, Ryanair have come a long way since their improvement plan started, and I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again. The only thing they could improve on now is to make use of other gate areas that are not so cramped/small, especially in STN.",Economy Class,y,2016-07-15,london stansted bucharest return two pleasant flight ryanair amazing much airline customer service improved recent year particularly allocated seating extra cabin baggage allowance use primary airport excellent mobile app feature significantly enhanced overall travel experience addition pleasing see ryanair begun using satellite stansted flight offer far relaxed boarding experience along much space seating compared satellite main gate area ryanair flight operate ryanair definitely consider making use facility underused often empty long period day fact flight operating flew onboard noticed service improved longer many tedious announcement particularly evening flight flight cabin crew friendly professional clearly ryanair come long way since improvement plan started hesitate fly thing could improve make use gate area cramped small especially stn,0.9874,Positive,855

My last flight from the UK to Germany only cost £20 return, an absolute bargain. The customer service too has seen a massive improvement over recent years with allocated seating, increased baggage allowance and a refreshed look with the new crew uniforms and cabin interiors. The cabin crew on my last flight were both friendly and welcoming and seemed to engage well with the passengers. The food and drinks on-board are pretty expensive as you'd imagine although on occasions have been cheaper than that offered in some of the airports I've been to, mainly in southern Europe it would seem. The only annoyance, especially when travelling without checked-in bags, is if the ground crew tag your cabin bag to go in the hold due space limitations, although on my last couple of flights the haven't done this and the crew were very accommodating in getting everyone's bags in the overhead lockers.

1245,L Cadwallader,"  Opted for Ryanair to fly Liverpool to Malaga and back rather than preferred easyJet on grounds of timings and price. Booked the return flight separately as paying in euros saved money, even using my credit card. Had problems trying to check in online as our computer does not seem to like the new Ryanair website and in the end could only do so via the old so-called Legacy website, only to discover that airport security and boarding gates struggle to read the boarding codes. Outward flight was fine and everyone seemed to get their hand luggage on board despite the flight being full. The return journey was less satisfactory. It was delayed by an hour with no explanation or apology given. Boarding at Malaga was in 3 groups: priority first, then rows 22 - 33, then everyone else. We could see that it made sense to board the back rows first when using an airbridge, but some prior warning would have been helpful as the existence of the display notices indicates that it is Ryanair policy. Then as the rest of us were boarded, the boarding agents immediately began to tag our cabin baggage for free hold storage without any warning, which necessitated extracting items wanted on board as we waited beyond the gate. It seemed that there must have been a pre-determined number of passengers to be selected for hand luggage removal as those at the back of the queue were allowed to keep their bags. In fact, as there was a large school party on board with minimal hand luggage, there would have been plenty of room for everyone's bags. We couldn't help feeling unfairly treated as we were near the front in the original queue, but relegated towards the rear and then selected for baggage extraction as well. The flight itself was ok, though we do find Ryanair seats rather numbing after a couple of hours.

I paid for one large bag while checking in. We planned to take a second bag as a carry on. Check in was very easy although there are still quite a few extra things they give you the option of purchasing at the last minute which can be annoying. Got to the bag drop at Faro and was very surprised to be asked if we wanted to check the second bag in free of charge. Apparently they do this if the flight is not full. We sat near the back of the plane and had the three seats to ourselves. I really like the seat allocation as this has completely eliminated the mad rush that I remember.

1254,C Charles,"  The flight from Berlin to East Midland Airports was on time. This is the first time I have flown with Ryanair and I paid for business plus which was a total waste of money. I was expecting what they advertised, priority boarding, no hassle on checking-in lugagge and security. In fact, I was had to queue up like usual to check in luggage, I did jump to their so called ""BusinessPlus"" counter to ask where to check in, staff asked me to stay back and wait, and nothing happened. When I was about to go into the priority boarding area, staff stopped me and asked me loudly: ""you have priority?"" When the bus came and we are about to board priority staff again stopped me and asked me again, ""are you in priority?"" I did have priority boarding but not on the plane, but only on the bus that transported us to board the plane. So when boarding the plane, we still boarded as usual in a long queue. The seat onboard is normal and I was sitting in the front row near an aisle, which was really annoying as the corridor was so small and people kept going to the toilet located just in front of my seat, and therefore, I could not enjoy the ""long leg room"" as the space is just too small. Overall, Ryanair is economical to fly with but remember, don't waste money on upgrading especially Business Plus which is a totally waste of money.

1257,Sadie Done,"  Malaga to Manchester on Ryanair. Unhappy with the customer service and attitude of the staff. When my flight was cancelled I was surprised with the lack of empathy and assistance that Ryanair staff offered. They did organise an alternative flight, however ignored my friend and I on numerous occasions, sent us running around the airport looking for our luggage without direction, shouted at other flyers whilst they were attempting to organise their return, did not offer food and drinks vouchers and were just unhelpful.

1259,Philip Cowell,"Manchester to Bratislava. Ryanair have much improved since I last flew with them around 5 years ago. Cabin crew both ways were friendly and their new uniforms look the part. The two bag policy is good and it sets them apart from other carriers and I'm glad they no longer micro examine the size of every carry on bag in the hope of eliciting some more money for a minor infringement - but truth be told, they've a lot of ground to make up on other low cost carriers who started to improve their customer experience long before Ryanair did. The seats are uncomfortable and cramped. No seat pocket annoys me and puts me off buying anything (still way overpriced). As does the broken tray table with a 45 degree slant meaning anything placed on it rolls into your lap. The fan fare on arrival irritates and is frankly crass. The seat rest and overhead bin adverts make remind me of a bus. The toilet is cramped.  The occupier of the aisle seat next to me had a bag that didn't fit under the seat in front of him resulting my having to clamber over it to get out mid flight. That'd be fun in an emergency. I know they are upgrading their fleet with new seats and interiors and I realise they make a lot of short journeys so wear and tear is inevitable, but Easyjet manage to provide more comfortable and clean aircraft with a better environment so why can't Ryanair?

1275,M Davis,"Flew Birmingham to Dublin with Ryanair, have never been on one of these flights that hasn't been at least 90% full, this time around 50% as extra flights had been laid on for Cheltenham and this was one of the flights going back to Dublin near empty which made for a very relaxing experience. I fly this route several times a month and usually default to Aer Lingus as they can be cheaper if planned and booked in advance. This time fares on both airlines were exorbitant thanks to St Patrick's Day and the Cheltenham Festival and Ryanair came out cheaper. Brand new 737 with new interior and the very pleasant staff resplendent in their new uniforms. After a very stressful journey to the airport it was lovely to be greeted by such friendly staff, relaxing interior, comfortable seat (I had paid for exit seat for extra leg room so can't comment on the regular seats) and lovely relaxing music. It all felt surreal because our go-to response to anything Ryanair has usually always been negative but this looks like it's set to change. A few years ago, when I had taken my first Ryanair flight in many years I actually laughed at the state of the garish interior but not any more. Why ever did Ryanair not make these changes years ago, I imagine they are going to elicit quite the competitive response from competitors and not just from the no-frills market either. One comment I would always have to make about Ryanair is that although they can be categorised as 'no frills', the same can't be said about being a 'low fares' airline as some of the fares, particularly on this busy route can sometimes resemble long-haul fares.

Of course they didn't and charged us 30 euros for a piece of paper. They don't have a decent customer service even for payment and we had to stay in a long queue for nearly an hour.

1301,J King,"Booked on a direct flight from Alicante to Edinburgh on Tuesday 26th January. We received a very short text from Ryanair on the Monday evening to inform us that our flight had been cancelled due to an air traffic control strike in France and a link to rebook our flight. We didn't know what to do at that point. We tried to call their customer service team but could not get an answer - later discovered they all go home at 6pm, because all problems go away at 6pm clearly. We eventually got hold of someone the following morning who told us that they would put us on the next flight to Edinburgh - 6 days later. Having small children at home and a job to go to this was not acceptable. Neither was their insistence that they would not pay for our extra accommodation costs as 'it wasn't their fault'. We discovered that Ryanair were the only airline that cancelled flights due the strike - everyone else just diverted. When we questioned them on this they could not give us any answer. After much discussion, they finally agreed to transfer our booking to a flight from Alicante to Dublin on Thursday (2 days) later however we would then not be able to get a connecting flight to Edinburgh until the Friday morning. On asking if they would put us up for the night in Dublin we were told no, we could keep our receipts and claim back but nothing was gauranteed - as again 'it wasn't their fault'. To add insult to injury, the flight from Dublin to Edinburgh was delayed. We had to pay out for 2 nights accommodation in Spain, a night in Dublin, meals, extra car parking at Edinburgh.

1304,M Farnan,Ryanair is a low cost airline so you need to be very careful with the booking and check-in arrangements. Any deviation will cost you almost as much as the ticket.

1305,L Shaw,"I know that Ryanair is an economy ""no frills"" airline but for goodness sake there are limits. Flew from Luton to Valletta. They tell you that you can take a bag into the cabin and then spend the next hour or so harassing you at every opportunity and asking you if you would like to check in that bag for free. The seats are bolt upright and cannot be moved, the pockets on the seat in front of you have vanished and there is approximately 4 inches between your knees and the seat in front (for a person with average length legs anyway). If you sit next to the window you end up freezing cold and getting wet as ice forms on the inside of the cabin wall and when you point it out on the way off the plane the pilot explains that it's because their air conditioning system is so efficient that it ices up. The call to go to the boarding desk is far too early which results in at over 150 people standing strung out across the boarding gates for three quarters of an hour whilst the staff checking you through to the plane know full well that the plane hasn't even landed, and of course they are happily chatting away in their seats behind the desk so they don't care. This is just cruel and unfair, especially to those people who find standing around quite difficult. The staff on board the aircraft were more interested in gossiping and playing around than paying attention to the passengers. They know that most people won't buy anything because Ryanair rip you off so they are totally disinterested in what they are doing.

I booked in July for a holiday to Faro in December, party of 4, of which 3 are disabled, 2 of which needed to use the abulift to access the aircraft. I booked special assistance at the time of booking and was allocated specific seats for out party to be able to access easily. We all booked in and went to special assistance area. All fine and good! Well apart from the huge queue that most people with limited diablilities could never stand in to go to bag drop. Flight called, we were taken to board the plane. Wait theres a massive problem, theres 6 people who have disabilities and need the abulift, but we were told Ryanair would only take 4! It seemed 2 others hadn't pre booked assistance but were allocated to board on the abulift. 2 of us in wheelchairs in my party were left on the tarmac whilst the special assistance and Ryanair argued about the fact the pilot wouldn't take more than 4! We got as far as the tarmac, sat for 10 minutes in the freezing cold wind whilst they tried to say we couldnt board. We were totally humiliated asked if we really needed to use the abulift and asked to prove wed booked special assistance, thankfully I always keep the paperwork safe. No other disabled passengers who were elderly were asked. It seems if you are young you can be challenged whether or not you actually need the help.  Ryanair staff would not help and it took one of the special assistance staff to say how ridiculous and bad the situation was, for us to actually get on the plane. We were told shortly before we may not be able to fly as its Ryanair policy that they only take 4 disabled people who cant climb the aircraft stairs. Maybe when Ryanair take your money they should let you know this. 4 people on a whole flight is beyond ridiculous, it does not take into consideration that most people with mobility problems or chronic illness would find it very difficult to climb steps and carry a hand luggage bag, forget those who are confined to a chair.

Safety and security instructions were given on a low volume PA system so that few people could barely hear it. Onboard, the seat was filthy from last passengers' food waste, the carpet was filthy with chewing gum, food and chips, and even the shabby looking steward didn't bother to put his shirt inside his trousers. Also, it looked as if his shirt apparently hadn't been ironed for a few weeks. Ordered a drink and a sandwich, was prompted to pay €17. After having done the maths for the stewardess, the price was suddenly €10. Ryanair has some kind of lottery sale onboard their flights. I don't know what this is all about, but it seemed a lot more interesting for cabin staff than the safety instructions. Upon landing in Kaunas I asked a steward what the local time was, but he had no idea that the time zone was one hour ahead of the departure airport. This is a filthy airline, and staff couldn't care less.  Some claim that low-cost is the future of flying. However, I have absolutely no trust in this joke of an airline.

Value for money is good though, especially if you book in time and don't need to bring much luggage. Both flights were uneventful and arrived on time. The flight from Dublin to Eindhoven (Friday) was however boarded by a rather large group of semi-drunk Irish (wo)men who continued their drinking during the flight, had to use the toilets all the time and blocked the aisle.

A second problem is that in order to be more customer friendly Ryanair now allows or does not care anymore if you take two or more pieces of luggage into the cabin. Some are huge and well over the size allowance. The result is either you board early or you will not find space for your small piece of luggage anymore. Boarding early does not help if you carry a soft bag as you will later see that the crew even help to squeeze hard suitcases into the overhead holds not caring about the content of your soft suitcase.

We explained that the child travelling with us was unwell, having been taking Calpol through the day, and asked if she would not transfer our luggage to the hold, especially as our arrival would be late evening. Asked about how long the delay at baggage reclaim would take, the staff member became very officious and suggested we were arguing with her. We had not been asked to give her our boarding passes until she had become very defensive - ""Are you going to give me your boarding passes?"" - when we handed them over immediately. She was obviously having a bad day, and did not transfer anyone else's baggage to the hold after us. We were left to remove valuables and repack our bags. As someone who works in a customer-focused business, I find it hard to believe that staff can get away with rudeness and off-handed comments on a daily basis.

1382,Grant Coull,"We were called to board on time, this morning, at 7:15am, for an 8am Ryanair departure. All seemed well. We had concerns after being delayed on the outbound flight from Edinburgh, 2 weeks earlier. After standing on a staircase for 10-15 minutes we were told to return to the departure lounge. The staff, not Ryanair, told us there was a problem with the plane and it may take at least an hour to resolve. We received no more updates and the notice boards simply said boarding and gate closed. At approx 9:15, the notice boards stated we had to board again, but from a different gate. The plane was fully boarded by 9:45am. The doors were closed at 10:02am, and we took off at 10:15am. This was a delay of 2 hours and 15 minutes. The captain said it was down to Spanish air traffic control, they told us it was French air traffic control that caused the outbound delay. As Ryanair's terms state that if you are delayed by at least 2 hours, you will receive a text stating your rights, explaining compensation etc. No text received. When I challenged the stewards they said they thought it was 3 hours, not 2! Wow they didn't even know their own rules. They weren't willing to help at all and said I should just complain directly to Ryanair. Which I will be doing.

I had a nice cup of coffee on the flight and while it cost 50% more than I might have liked, it was good quality. The flight was not completely full so there were few issues with hand luggage and so on, and I like being able to take two bags with me as this saves a great deal of hassle. Downsides were due to Stansted's overcrowding. There is nowhere to sit while you wait for a flight, as they are rebuilding. The security is chaotic and unnecessarily stressful as they have not invested very intelligently in the screening equipment and they have rather bizarrely chosen hardware that increases rather than reduces processing time. Finally we were somewhat kettled in a holding bay near gate 88 by ground crew without explanation before boarding, while another flight disgorged its passengers, and I think it might have been better for Ryanair to send us down a bit later, as some of the families and older passengers grew uncomfortable with nowhere to sit. The Stansted experience is starting to put me off using EasyJet and Ryanair, and I often choose Heathrow and scheduled flights instead.

1416,Alison Smith,After paying £70.00 return for my Ryanair flight for travelling in June 2015 I was disgusted and dismayed to find that Ryanair have hiked up their prices for exactly the same travel dates in June 2016 to over £200.00 return. After emailing to ask for an explanation for this extortionate price hike - given that oil and fuel costs are at one of their lowest - I was dissatisfied with their response that they always offer the best price on their website (where else would I be looking?). The following is their list of price determining factors : number of passengers already booked on a flight : flight time : Day of travel : time of year - high season/low season etc. Given that we are travelling on the same flights and the same period which have virtually only just become available I fail to see how such a price increase can be justified other than pure greed and the mindset that they have a captive audience.

1422,K Barber,"Me and my partner booked a last minute holiday to Lanzorote for a week and our only option was to fly with Ryanair as it was short notice and the price we paid for it was decent. We have always booked online and never had an issue with any other airline until it had come to our attention that we had to pay to sit together with was £20 each. At the time we assumed it was because we had booked short notice so we was fine to pay that. However, when we got to the airport (after checking in online a week before ) we were asked to pay £70 each for luggage on the way there and £35 each on the way back! I was so angry as there is nothing that states when you book your holiday that you have to ""check in"" your luggage too? The only question you are asked is if you want to check in ""extra luggage"" - well to me we didn't have extra it was just a standard suitcase and hand luggage (which pretty much everyone takes when they go away). So when you book online that's how they catch you out as they word it wrong by saying extra luggage rather than just a standard luggage. The staff were really abrupt and rude and not really bothered about the hassle this had caused us. Following this, my partner had to ask about luggage on the way back they didn't inform us. Again, there was nothing whilst we were booking to inform us that we had to do this only to check in ""extra luggage"" and I was not aware that my only suitcase had to be classed as extra. Its very misleading!  We normally don't take our bank cards with us on holiday but its a good job we did. To everyone that reads this please take it on board as some people may not be able to afford that kind of money upfront when they charge you which was what happened to the couple in front of us! The staff at the desk said that the information was in the ""small print"" which I think is awful as a vital piece of information like that, in my opinion, should not be in the small print! I have never known so much hassle to go on holiday in all my life and we have booked before with other airlines online and never ever had any issues with luggage. We will never fly with Ryanair again and strongly advise to anyone who is thinking of flying with them to think carefully and go with another airline if you can as you will probably end up paying again what you pretty much paid for the holiday.

1424,P Shaw,"This is a review based on my Ryanair experiences at Madrid Barajas airport on 23 September 2015. I arrived 2 hrs early at around 1130 for the 1335 flight. At around 1300 our Boarding Cards were checked and we went down the ramp to embark. At around 1320 we were asked to return to the Departure Lounge due to a technical issue. For the next 3 hrs we were not advised of the issue nor of the plans to get us back to the UK. Gradually over that time people would ask the 2 (relatively junior) staff members of Ryanair and 'news', or lack of it, would filter down the line. No announcements were made. By around 1700 we heard that a plane was on its way and we would depart at around 1930. Ok, 6 hrs delay but at least we'd be home. The 2 officials then handed out photocopies of the EU regulations regarding flight delays etc - useful, but to be honest we just wanted to get home! As can be imagined, people then were asking lots of questions of the 2 lads. At around the same time food vouchers were being handed out and stamped by the 2 officials. However, not one of the food outlets would take the vouchers because Ryanair had tried this in the past and had not paid their bills to the food outlets! At around 1830 the 1930 departure disappeared off the departures list. We heard that another flight had been delayed and our rescue plane had been used for those passengers - presumably to avoid 2 sets of compensation!! Time progressed slowly, we then found out that a flight would take us back to the UK around 2305. The flight actually left at 2330 - 10 hrs late. During the 10 hrs, the 200 or so customers were shunted at least 5 times between Gates - can you imagine 200 people racing around getting from A to B! Ok, these things happen. Lessons to be learnt?  Ryanair, have someone on the ground such as a manager to deal with the situation and inform people officially by adequate communication. Pay your bills to the local food outlets. Having reported all the above, I've travelled extensively for the past few years to Spain and back and used Ryanair a lot. Mostly they are cheap and get you there on time; its just at times such as the above where you realise their service is quite flaky.

1425,N Kruse,"Ryanair seems attractive because of their cheap prices, but their service is pretty lousy. My flight to London was delayed for almost 3 hours; none of the staff at the gate informed us about what was going on and what the reason for the delay was (only when people started walking up to them and asked, everyone kind of found out from the people sitting next to them). Conveniently the flight was delayed just a little under 3 hours so you're not even able to claim a refund. Because of the delay I missed my connecting flight in London (it was already about 8pm), which is why I went to ask for assistance. Their employee was pretty rude and offered no help; she just told me that I booked the two flights at my own risk and that I wasn't gonna get any assistance by Ryanair. Unfortunately there was no flight left to my final destination that day (which I would have had to pay out of my own pocket, of course), which is why I had to book an overnight bus and had a horrible 24hr trip instead of 8 hrs. On my flights back everything luckily went smoothly, but I noticed that boarding was really chaotic at all flights (a woman with her baby in a stroller was pretty much first in line to board and had to wait about 20 mins until all other passengers had boarded to get some help carrying the stroller down the stairs - of course, staff also weren't able to turn on the escalator at least). I wouldn't fly with Ryanair again, because despite their (in my case not even that cheap) prices their service is just the worst I've ever experienced. I've gone on many flights and faced many delays but have always received assistance and been booked on another flight/hotel etc at the airline's expense.

1440,Tom Lewis,"Ryanair may be ""low cost"" but their tickets are not necessarily cheap (sometimes more expensive than BA for example) by the time you have paid quite large sums for the privilege of travelling with a bag etc. They are most certainly cheap when it comes to airport services and very expensive for anything purchased onboard. The check-in process at Birmingham was perfunctory but quick, security a fairly long process as usual with inadequate staff, and boarding was fine until we stood in the airbridge for 15 minutes only to find that it was not connected anyway and so then had to descend the steps on to the ramp before going up the airstairs on the aircraft - certainly not good for the elderly and/or infirm. Similarly in Murcia, check-in was ok but long queues had formed by the time staff turned up and we were made to stand in the hot sun for 20+ minutes until the crew deigned to let us on board. At Birmingham once again no airbridge. All very convenient, I am sure, for Ryanair but not so for their customers. The cabin crew were amateur at best and seem to be there mainly to extract more cash from the passengers : all their prices are ridiculous and a claim that perfume etc is ""40% less than the high street"" is at best disingenuous. On the positive side the aircraft are clean, albeit uncomfortable, and the flights operated within 30 minutes of schedule.

Their system is based on the customer bringing his/her boarding pass ahead of time. We did not realise this, and they send us to pay 50 Euros for each ticket (for a family of 5 it was 250 Euros). Payments are done in a different ""office"", so I had to go there and stand for 20 min in a very unorganized line. When I came back to check-in the agent was very upset that we didn't pay for our suitcases, almost yelling at us. Guess what? we didn't know about this as well. So now she sent me again for the same ""office"" to pay another 200 Euros. Now, however there is only one line instead of two, so it takes another 30 minutes to pay the fee.

1450,Nihan Ulusoy,"Ryanair uses the motto Low Fares Airline as a trap, to be honest. We bought our tickets for a short domestic flight for a good price. However the ridiculous add-on charges (55x4 euros per check-in at the airport fee + 67euros for a 22 kg luggage) made it cost much much more. I understand the luggage fee. However 220 euros airport check-in fee is twice the price of our total ticket cost! Finding this cost info on their website is almost impossible (it is literally hidden on the website - you have to search for that particular thing really). Their ""don't forget to check-in online"" e-mails can easily be ignored because they don't mention any airport check-in fee. It looks like a choice, not a must-do. At least three more couple of people paid that meaningless fee. Because they were not aware of it. If this airlines were for budget travelers and really cared about customer service, they would warn travelers about those ridiculous add-on fees. A fee should offer a service, so its value should be reasonable compared with the service it gives. So we paid 220 euros for a single check-in (not four - because normal airlines do a single check-in per reservation) done by a sour-faced check-in officer who scolded us like we were little kindergarden children.

The terms regarding boarding passes are clear and the technology savvy can easily find out this information. I see one review about using apps to check in with other airlines, so why such a tech block with Ryanair? They have an app, it reminds you of your flight even without, and the email in gmail tells you to check in (gives a link) follow the link and it tells you to print, or download boarding pass. Anyway, extremely efficient. Which was wonderful with 3 kids in tow. I cannot complain whatsoever. The luggage was not a problem again you just have to be savvy and dont try to go over just incase.

1472,Colin Bristow,"I am not a regular user of low cost airlines but on this occasion used Ryanair on due to the holiday destination airport (Chania, Crete). The check-in clerk however could benefit from a refresher course in customer service as he appeared extremely bored and disinterested. However my complaint starts when we did not print off our return boarding passes in advance of the holiday and although we tried to reserve our seats for the return flight, so my family could sit together we were unable to do this via their web-site. We gave up after 2 attempts and assumed we would check-in on arrival and take whatever seats available. We of course were not aware that they would be an additional charge for printing a boarding pass and was advised by the desk clerk to check-in on-line, again we tried to do this via our smart phone but again were unable to access the booking on the web-site. As we had spent a considerable amount of time and with mounting stress from my wife, I was forced to pay the additional charge. The 3 boarding passes were duly hand written in 10 minutes by the Servisair clerk and 135€ extracted. The clerk even told us we were lucky to get the last 3 seats even though we had booked and paid for them. I find these charges levied by Ryanair are totally disproportionate to the administration involved and are punitive in the extreme and are extracted under stressful circumstances. Up to this point we had enjoyed a fabulous holiday only to have it spoiled on our return. I have a number of issues with this penalty charge, firstly; it is not clear on their web-site when making the on-line seat reservations and printing the boarding passes for the outbound flight that you need to make the same arrangements for the return flight (or is it Ryanair’s intention to catch out the new customers?) and secondly, I regularly travel for both business and pleasure with a number of different airlines and have never come across such a policy for boarding passes. I regularly use on-line booking and the barcode via smart phone but generally this is within 24 hours prior to departure and I have never been charged for a boarding pass, this is not the industry norm. I made a complaint to Ryanair and got a stock answer hiding behind the T&C's and no refund.

Not the airlines fault and Captain continually updated us. In fact his best update was yet to come. Finally departed bit sooner than originally informed. Inflight service again professional and courteous. Yes, prices can be slightly high, but they are on trains too, but not too over priced, in my opinion. Certainly was no strong selling on this flight. Further delay as we approached Palma, this time due to the weather, but again superbly informed and updated by the pilot, who made sure to tell us we had enough fuel of course. Eventually arrived approximately 1 hour late, into a torrential downpour, thankfully to a stand and not a remote stand with bus trip.

That is when she told me that because the flight was full, I would be allowed to check in my one rolling bag free of charge. After security, boarding of the flight was impressive in terms of smoothness and professionalism. There were two lines: priority for those who prepaid their seat and general for those who chose not to spend a few extra euros for excellent service and benefits. The priority line has seats for passengers but the general boarding did not. I was the first to board. I quickly found my aisle exit row seat and sat.

1494,Leslie Cadwallader,"Second round trip with Ryanair this year and all went fairly smoothly. Had booked early for a good price and managed to check in for return flight at home before leaving for Liverpool airport early in the morning, so avoided any extra charges. Did have a 30 minutes delay on the outward journey which was attributed to Belgian ATC because of the ""very busy skies over Europe this morning"", but since boarding (for an early morning flight) did not start till about 20 minutes before scheduled departure time I suspect we simply missed our designated slot. Also there was a puzzling request from the cabin manager that passengers should make sure they sat in their allocated seats because of the carefully arranged weight distribution. Given that the plane was completely full, how and where was weight distribution arranged? Plenty of sales pitches on both legs, but my impression was that many of the passengers just switched off and sales were actually fewer than on flights I've had with easyJet.

The cabin crew were friendly and did a good job on board. The only negative comment I can say is that they had ran out of Prosecco (except for 1 bottle) on both flights and we were sitting in Row 3! The bar seemed poorly stocked and on the return flight I heard that there was no hot food available. I am not surprised as the passengers were only getting off our aircraft 5 minutes before we boarded it to return home. I never saw an aircraft turned around so quickly in all my years of travel.

1501,A Pease,"I'm starting to fly this route more regularly, and for the first time have to report what I consider to be a significant failing with the cabin crew. Our plane (FR7974) left late (after a late inbound arrival). I was sitting in Row 2. There was a minimal announcement from the flight deck naming the crew but nothing to invite the passengers to listen attentively to the safety briefing, which is often the final point made during the cockpit pre-flight passenger announcement. The announcement was very quiet and the delivery was monotone. I appreciate that the flight deck crew wanted to get a slot and head back to London as quickly as possible so their priorities might be elsewhere. The pasenger safety briefing was voiced by the female cabin crew member but it was impossible to hear (even in row 2). Even the young man doing the demonstration seemed frustrated by the lack of interest being shown. When I asked the female cabin crew why she had not stopped the briefing and reminded the passengers to pay attention, she told me it was not really worth it, because 'they (the passengers) wouldn't do it and anyway they fly so regularly that they don't need to listen to it because they know what to do by now'. The drinks run and duty free run were very speedy, leading to the crew spending around 10 mins in the forward galley area spilling out into the aisle in full sight of the passengers each with a mobile phone in their hand and chatting. Apart from the young man cabin crew at the front who made a personal, animated and delightful appeal for the scratch card run, and whose cabin service was friendly and most welcome, this cabin crew seemed to be the most uninterested and switched off that I have travelled with in over 15 years of travelling with Ryanair.

On the outward flight awful overpriced food was offered and there were 2 ‘scratch card runs ‘. On a two and a half hour flight? There being no on board magazine or duty free menu is it any wonder nobody buys any duty free goods – nobody has any idea what is for sale. At the end of the flight there was no thanks or goodbye as we left the plane the first time in 35 years I have ever had this. The two cabin crew by the rear doors totally ignored the departing passengers whilst chatting in their own language. Very unprofessional cabin crew that day. On the journey back the cabin crew were much better. There was only one scratchcard run and one hard sell on the breakfast lasagne that ‘melted in your mouth ‘. No thanks. Our real issue as we were waiting in the queue (towards the back) to embark a ground staff came up the line and attached yellow stickers to our hand luggage and boarding pass. She spoke no English, and we eventually worked out our hand luggage (which was all we had by choice) was now going in the hold. This was a bit of a disaster for us as we were now being forced to wait at the baggage reclaim at the other end , a wait which proved to be about half an hour meaning we overshot out car parking time and had to pay excess. Despite this sticker business some people behind us in the queue were removing the stickers prior to embarking and just taking the luggage on the plane anyway. But we played the game and tried to safeguard some delicate stuff we had. Despite this on arrival home we found that some articles were damaged, something that should never have happened in the first place. So, in a nutshell if you are prepared to forsake everything for a cheap flight Ryanair are the best in the business. If the travelling is a big part of your trip, avoid them like the plague.

1529,J Gardiner,"2nd June Flight from Bergamo to East Midlands. Whilst in the queue to board a member of staff tagged my hand luggage and boarding pass with yellow  stickers. I was just over half way down the queue. All the people around me were being tagged so thought nothing of it. On boarding I moved to my seat half way along the plane. A member of
the crew who was stood near to my seat told me my bag should've been left at the entrance and put in the hold. I had at no point before this been told to do so. The aisle was rammed with passengers but she still wanted me to take my bag off the plane. After much discussion I persuaded her to let me put my bag in the overhead where there was plenty of space and I would remove it if necessary. I sat and watched many more passengers board who had arrived much later than me (no stickers on their bags) as it happened there was plenty of space in the lockers so my bag stayed put. I had booked hand luggage only as I needed to be out of the airport quickly. My bag was not oversized and I was nowhere near the back of the queue for boarding.

1530,D Morrell,"Glasgow to Bydgoszcz on Friday 5th June. Well this was supposed to be the date at 4.30pm. This was then delayed an hour. So it gets to 5.30pm and off I go to board, all good lets us board the plane. Once everyone is on they then announce there is a technical issue and leave us on a hot plane for 1.5 hrs. They then tell us the flight is
cancelled and we need to disembark. Arrange another flight for us at 8.45pm. So we are waiting around for hours with a £3.50 voucher provided for food and drink. Anyone that knows airports knows that this would get you a bottle of water if your lucky! So take 2 go to board for the 8.45pm flight, get to the gate and even though the
plane is there they tell us we are not going and no explanation as to why. We then have to go and collect any luggage and when I ask if there is any news get rudely told to go ""stand over there!"" Finally they arrange to get us taxi's to a local hotel. Well 6 taxi's for a whole flight took quite a lot of time. It's midnight by the time I get there and the front desk tell us we need to be ready for 5am. So get to the airport for 5am, the flight is then put back an hour. Finally time to board and not a member of staff in sight, they finally arrive at 8.30 and start to board us. Once everyone is on board we then have to sit there to wait for ""paperwork"" and then another passenger. Finally we leave after 9.30am but are then told there are no drinks or food on board.

1534,N Moss,"FR2005, Stansted to Otopeni, Romania. This was our first flight with Ryanair and we approached it with a degree of caution and apprehension. I have to say, that these feelings were unfounded. Ryanair in 2015, simply do not deserve the reputation they have. The entire booking process was easy to understand and administer. Follow the rules and it works well and easy. The flight itself was bang on time, smooth and a joy. A few of our fellow passengers were an issue, with what we understood to be their pre-emptively abrupt attitude with staff which was mildly unpleasant and entirely unnecessary but perhaps a hangover of Ryanair of old. I think that all Ryanair need to do now to complete their transformation to a customer friendly carrier, is make water affordable on board. Perhaps £1 for a 500ml bottle of water wouldn't be too much to ask?

1535,G Baskerville,Flew with Ryanair for the first time from Alicante to Manchester. I had not printed off my boarding passes for the three of us. I was not able to do this where we were staying. They then wanted 45 euros from each off us to do this. I managed to get to a PC at the airport and do it myself. The queues for check in were like Russian Bread Queues from the 1970's. When we eventually go to the front the check in clerk next to our queue (without any notice) closed his queue and then his queue tried to push into ours. It was appalling and could have escalated into something nasty all due to the bad customer service from Ryanair. I also witnessed an elderly disabled passenger become very distressed when she learned she could not take her collapsible walking aid onto the plane even though she'd been told in advance that she could.

1540,Yevheniy Kahanovych,I opted for Ryanair due to needing a direct flight from Gdansk to London. I read all the small print and rules to be able to pay the correct price for bag fast boarding and emergency row seat. These extras added up to about 100% to the initial price tag but even then it was quite cheap (some 70USD one-way all inclusive). There was no trouble with booking as well as with online check in. I was even able to download mobile boarding pass through the app. At the airport I only spent abut 10 minutes for bag check and visa verification. At the gate my experience was not overly pleasant with some 200 people with screaming children left on the stairs leading to the apron for about 20 minutes. Then door opened and crowd went to the plane. Since I booked priority boarding I had no trouble reaching my seat and accommodating my bag. The crew were polite and helpful. Since their hand baggage limit is strict there was no problem finding space for bags. We took off on time. The inflight experience was up to expectations but not as annoying as some wrote here. No seat recline but plenty of legroom in emergency row. The plane was very tatty but clean. Toilet was ok. We landed 10 mins ahead of schedule. Then usual labyrinth of Stansted terminal and unbelievable immigration lines for EU citizens. Due to being Ukraine national I was directed to the non-EU line which consisted of some 15-20 people so it took me 10 minutes to pass border control. My bag was already on the belt I was off the airport 20 minutes after landing. Absolutely bearable experience; you'll have no trouble if you carefully read their instruction and spend extra 10 minutes on booking process.

1546,Raymond Bailey,"Flight FR9810 from London Stansted to Barcelona El Prat T2 on Monday 4th May 2015 scheduled to leave at 08.15 However due to Barcelona being fog bound they had delayed all flights into Barcelona apparently from many UK airports. We were firstly informed that a delay of 1.5 hours was estimated. After a while we were informed that another 1 hour had been added. So all passengers sat on the plane for 2.5 hours. Our first complaint - Sitting in a stationary hot metal tube for 2.5 hours is not my idea of enjoyment particularly when nobody was offered even the smallest drink of complimentary cold water in order to alleviate the discomfort. During the 2.5 hour delay there would have been time to have some water delivered. The irony in all of this is that shortly after take-off the cabin crew came round selling drinks. Our second complaint - Flight FR9015 Thursday 7th May - El Prat to Stansted. Taking advantage of the 10kg on board baggage allowance + small bag we purchased a second ""carry on"" cabin bag (size within stipulated regulation). On the outward journey not a problem. A different story on the return flight though. On entry to the plane I was told by a Stewardess ""That is not a cabin bag!"" I explained that we had no problems on the outward journey the cabin crew were quite happy. Not being convinced she repeated the statement ""That is not a cabin bag!""

1550,D Steedman,"I travel frequently with Ryanair mostly because its destinations and schedules are convenient.

1551,N Hamer,First time with Ryanair flying Stansted to Prague. Good price more competitively priced now than Easyjet hence deciding to travel with them instead. Flight left a little late but made up for the delay in the air and landed on time. Cabin basic and not particularly clean- we literally passed the departing passengers from our plane across the tarmac so obviously no time there to clean the plane - however if speedy turnaround keeps costs down I can put up with a few crumbs. Did not pay for allocated seating but got two decent seats one by the window. If they reduced allocated seating costs I might have considered it. Return flight also bang on time leaving and arrived early. Pilots friendly and informative although very difficult to hear as engines seemed much noisier than other airlines. Staff were definitely not as friendly as other airlines rolling eyes at passengers etc which is a shame as being cheap shouldn't mean poorer customer service. I am meticulous about measuring hand luggage as I do not want to be charged extra but the shapes and sizes of bags being allowed on was hilarious- some people looked like they'd packed for a 3 week cruise. Everything was allowed on and massive bags which would never have fitted in the cabin were allowed in the hold free of charge. Overhead lockers were completely crammed with massive hand luggage items.

1552,Jan-Adriaan du Plessis,I booked a fairly priced return ticket between Dublin and Edinburgh in May 2015. The experience was horrible. I think the check-in and baggage drop works okay as long as you only have hand luggage and a European or UK passport. If you need to check in a bag or you require a visa it's absolute chaos. There is no clear signage the staff keeps directing you to a different queue that already has at least 50 people waiting. This was the closest I've ever come to missing a flight. The price of my ticket increased threefold with the bag I checked in (less than 20kg btw) and they even charge 15 euro to print your boarding pass. This borders on criminal if you ask me.

1554,Davide Greco,FR4774 May 14th and FR4775 May 18th. I have never been a fan of this airline but I have to admit they are moving forward and slowly getting closer to what I consider to be an enjoyable carrier to fly with (for short haul flights). Flew BGY to SKG last week for a short Greek holiday with no issue at all: on time departures/arrivals good rate for the ticket and above all some improvements I did notice compared to the last time I flew with them about 3 years ago. The main one is of course the seat allocation for everyone which prevent people from rushing to the aircraft as if it was a bus school trip. I also found seat comfort and legroom to have improved and even the cabin crew seems a bit more professional and friendly now even if they still talk too much in my opinion during the flight to try and sell whatever the can to the passengers. Another positive news is that there is no longer (at least according to my experience) an obsessive check of your hand baggage dimensions and weight at the gate which I do appreciate. Generally speaking if you check the rules carefully and comply with them you can get a great value for money as well as good and frequent direct connections. The day they stop boarding the plane half an hour before the plane is actually ready to welcome passengers onboard (thus causing people to wait on the stairs/bus/apron for up to 15 minutes) they will probably see me much more often on their planes.,Economy Class,y,2015-05-25,fr may th fr may th never fan airline admit moving forward slowly getting closer consider enjoyable carrier fly short haul flight flew bgy skg last week short greek holiday issue time departure arrival good rate ticket improvement notice compared last time flew year ago main one course seat allocation everyone prevent people rushing aircraft bus school trip also found seat comfort legroom improved even cabin crew seems bit professional friendly even still talk much opinion flight try sell whatever passenger another positive news longer least according experience obsessive check hand baggage dimension weight gate appreciate generally speaking check rule carefully comply get great value money well good frequent direct connection day stop boarding plane half hour plane actually ready welcome passenger onboard thus causing people wait stair bus apron minute probably see much often plane,0.9904,Positive,895
1555,Leslie Cadwallader,MAN-PMI-MAN. Usually fly with easyJet from Liverpool but Ryanair schedules appeared first and I found cheap flights for our preferred days. Had a later bonus in that our original outward flight in the evening was cancelled and we were transferred to the morning flight which had been dearer at the time of booking. I read all the rules carefully and intended to pay for seats so that we could print off our return boarding passes before we left home. I was subsequently shocked to find that even standard seats would cost £10.99 per person per flight and this was not even high season. In the end I got up extra early on the morning of our outward journey and printed off the return passes at 02.15! It was noticeable that hardly any standard seats had been booked in advance: perhaps if the charge was less Ryanair would actually find more people choosing to pay. The flights themselves went off largely without incident. We were late departing from Manchester but then we did not start to board the plane until 15 minutes before official departure time yet this was early in the morning. I found it difficult to hear any of the announcements partly because of the noise of the engines and passengers talking loudly to compensate but also because of the gabbled way in which they were delivered. The return crew were much better in this respect despite the senior steward looking to be all of 14 years of age. Not much attention seemed to be paid to luggage sizing and it looked as if everyone got their hand luggage on board despite a completely full outward flight. Both crews worked hard throughout the flights but we were starting to descend towards Mallorca before the drinks round reached us on the outward leg. Overall though one cannot complain when we paid under £120 for two of us to fly to Mallorca for a week. When we first went there over 20 years ago we were lucky to find return flights for £200 per person in low season.,Economy Class,y,2015-05-22,man pmi man usually fly easyjet liverpool ryanair schedule appeared first found cheap flight preferred day later bonus original outward flight evening cancelled transferred morning flight dearer time booking read rule carefully intended pay seat could print return boarding pass left home subsequently shocked find even standard seat would cost per person per flight even high season end got extra early morning outward journey printed return pass noticeable hardly standard seat booked advance perhaps charge le ryanair would actually find people choosing pay flight went largely without incident late departing manchester start board plane minute official departure time yet early morning found difficult hear announcement partly noise engine passenger talking loudly compensate also gabbled way delivered return crew much better respect despite senior steward looking year age much attention seemed paid luggage sizing looked everyone got hand luggage board despite completely full outward flight crew worked hard throughout flight starting descend towards mallorca drink round reached u outward leg overall though one complain paid two u fly mallorca week first went year ago lucky find return flight per person low season,0.875,Positive,1226

1559,Jill Morrison,I have been a passenger with numerous airlines since 1957 and in recent years frequently from Alicante to several different British airports. Ryanair is one of the worst I've ever travelled with and definitely the worst on this route. On the outward Alicante/East Midlands Airport journey we sat on the runway for almost an hour because they had missed their slot. This made for a long and tedious journey. This however was nowhere near as bad as the return flight. We left plenty of time to return the hire car and arrive at the airport in time to have a leisurely lunch (as we always do at Gatwick) as we knew that it would be late when we arrived home only to discover that we could not enter the departure lounge until 2 hours before our flight was due to leave. This would have been okay if there had been somewhere for two elderly passengers to sit (all chairs were taken and we were left standing with all our luggage) or somewhere to have a decent meal (there is one very unappetising place with food served in cardboard). Also two hours would have been sufficient time if it hadn't taken more than an hour to wind our way through the queue to the check in desk. When we arrived at the desk we were told that our case was too heavy (1kg overweight) most airlines will waive this fractional overweight but the representative told us that we had only paid for 15kg and would have to put the excess in our hand baggage. This we did in full view of the other passengers and consisted of 2 tee-shirts and a pair of light shoes. Whilst we were waiting to board the aircraft the attendant asked us if we would like to put our hand baggage in the hold free of charge! My logic and fairly basic grasp of maths cannot make sense of this! I had been warned not to travel Ryanair and I never will again.,Economy Class,n,2015-05-18,passenger numerous airline since recent year frequently alicante several different british airport ryanair one worst ever travelled definitely worst route outward alicante east midland airport journey sat runway almost hour missed slot made long tedious journey however nowhere near bad return flight left plenty time return hire car arrive airport time leisurely lunch always gatwick knew would late arrived home discover could enter departure lounge hour flight due leave would okay somewhere two elderly passenger sit chair taken left standing luggage somewhere decent meal one unappetising place food served cardboard also two hour would sufficient time taken hour wind way queue check desk arrived desk told case heavy kg overweight airline waive fractional overweight representative told u paid kg would put excess hand baggage full view passenger consisted tee shirt pair light shoe whilst waiting board aircraft attendant asked u would like put hand baggage hold free charge logic fairly basic grasp math make sense warned travel ryanair never,0.3023,Neutral,1051
1560,M Ridley,I am disabled and booked for assistance with Ryanair at Birmingham airport. On arrival I was told to queue and check in before I could be given a wheelchair. My husband had to push the chair when we finally got it. At the gate Ryanair staff discussed who would not be able to take the flight as there were too many disabled. They talked about us as if we were bags of carrots. Eventually I said I would try to climb the steps of the aircraft and was allowed onto the plane. At no time was I given any assistance. On arrival in Malta I had to struggle to baggage and out of the airport as no assistance was available. You need to be fit and agile to use this airline.

1563,Benjamin Campbell,FR 507 30th April. FR 506 7th May. It may be said that one gets what one pays for but by the time Ryanair has ripped through you with thier suite of extra charges many of which are simply an unfair cash grab on their unsuspecting customers at the booking counter when there is no chance of taking another airline Ryanair is not well priced. On a flight from Dublin to Bristol we were encouraged to use Ryanairs smartphone App or print out out a boarding pass to avoid an extra charge to have it printed at the booking counter. Unfortunately the App didn't work so on arriving at Dublin we were directed to the misnamed 'Customer Service' counter to be 'helped' by the most unhelpful unpleasant rude eye rolling young woman I have ever had the misfortune to encounter in many years of air travel with many airlines all over the world. When I explained the problem she tried to tell me that if the App didn't work I had plenty of time in Ireland to hunt down an Internet cafe or similar with access to a printer to print out my boarding pass and that she should now charge me for printing them out at the airport. I was then charged for an extra 3kg of baggage even though the two of us had no carry on baggage. The plane was dirty tired and run down and the cabin staff non professional. The seats are small and cramped. In summary terrible service from rude staff will strip you of cash any chance they get tired dirty aircraft poor inflight service.

As a very frequent airline passenger I must point out that there are more and more budget airlines in the world and competition for the passengers is tougher every single day.

1565,A Clarke,A return trip from Dublin to Malaga for a friends wedding the flight over left slightly late due chaotic boarding by the pax who seemed rather clueless as to what to do once you board a plane so you can't blame Ryanair for that. As per my last flights on FR they ran out of food and drink items and had a very limited selection and the service by a crew with a combined age of about 17 were slow and one rather got the impression that the four of them had just qualified the previous afternoon. They seemed stressed by the whole process and were again slow from the aft galley which is a surprise considering the lack of items they could possibly sell. There was a minor medical emergency where a pax fainted but they were quick and very attentive to deal with the situation. The flight back was again bereft of items from to purchase which was odd given that the plane was sitting on the ground the whole time I was at the gate before boarding (over an hour) but then even when you want to purchase something it's a bit of a guessing game due to the fact there are no menus. Anyway the flight began boarding early so early there were neither flight nor cabin crew on board. The flight itself was an awful experience due to being surrounded by children who took to screaming the majority of the time while their parents looked like they wanted to chuck themselves out the window. If I thought that the front of the cabin were an adults only area I would have paid anything to sit there maybe something to think about?

There was the traditional queue for a Ryanair flight even though you have an assigned seat. I prefer to wait until the queue is actually moving and join the queue then instead of standing for no reason. No complaints about the flight - I think some of the food/drinks are overpriced but in general there is a good selection. I have noticed on recent Ryanair flights that the level of customer service have improved. There seems to be more Irish and British crew on the Irish and British flights too. I noticed the crew were especially friendly with the children on board with 2 young kids being shown into the cockpit as they saw the pilot on exiting the plane and the male cabin crew member on the tramac waving at other children as they came down the aircraft steps.

I thought these rear (and front) seats cost extra? Anyway not complaining as it meant speedy disembarkation at both destinations. Good to see that the Ryanair charm offensive has not run out of steam and they really do seem to be making serious efforts to up their public image. Return leg absolutely full but boarding was efficient enough and we arrived 20 mins early. Both flights were on two of FR's more elderly planes (those in the EI-DC* range) and frankly they are starting to show a lot of wear and tear which is hardly surprising when you consider how hard they work. Have the food and drink prices gone up recently? £4.50 for a coffee and a biscuit seems a bit OTT to me but I guess you don't have to buy. In summary a couple of years ago I'd have advised anyone to avoid Ryanair at all costs if there was even a vaguely convenient alternative.

1579,L Balfour,Flying from Faro to Glasgow Prestwick. I have flown with Ryanair before on short flights from Glasgow to Dublin which were fine (although had us standing outside in the freezing cold waiting to board for 20 minutes). Faro to Glasgow was a 3 hour flight and I am 6 months pregnant. I had to drag my suitcase up the stairs to board the plane and stand waiting there for a good 10 minutes until other passengers had taken their seats. When we arrived at our seats there was no room in the overhead stow for our luggage as other passengers had obviously ran out of space in their own areas and decided just to cram 4 cases into ours leaving us with nothing. My husband had to try and make room for our bags in stows away from where we were sitting. During this the cabin crew just gormlessly stood by and offered no assistance. Menus were handed out but only to passengers in the front seats as they didn't have enough to go round. It was a lunchtime flight and I was hungry and asked the stewardess while she was passing with the trolley if I could buy a panini. I was told they had ran out (again as there was only enough for the passengers in the front seats). No alternative was offered. The staff looked tired and fed up.

Although a few weeks before I received notice that the flight time had changed which required some workarounds in my own schedule in addition to the flight ultimately being delayed. Although everything was acceptable in general I also rather didn't like how non-EU/EEA citizens have to go to the bag drop line for visa checks which took an additional 30 minutes before going through security simply because the line was so long. I also realized the seats do not recline I'm not sure if this was because of the route or if all their aircraft are like this in general but I definitely would not want to go on a long flight with them if this were the case!,Economy Class,n,2015-04-27,went stn mr without incident flight although week received notice flight time changed required workarounds schedule addition flight ultimately delayed although everything acceptable general also rather like non eu eea citizen go bag drop line visa check took additional minute going security simply line long also realized seat recline sure route aircraft like general definitely would want go long flight case,0.875,Positive,410
1582,N Sharp,I was due to fly back from Ireland with my husband and two kids when my daughter contracted chickenpox. I contacted the airline four days before the flight and explained that my husband and daughter would not be travelling with us but that my mother had purchased another ticket and would be sitting in my husband's seat (I didn't think this was necessary as we had paid the additional fee to sit in the seats that we chose but wanted to make sure my mother's journey was stress free). It was confirmed that this would be fine. When we got to the airport we made sure it was still ok as my mother has limited mobility and finds air travel extremely difficult. They confirmed again that they had kept the seat we had paid for. When we got to the gate my mother had paid for priority boarding but a stuff up by the staff there meant we were left waiting to get onto the plane until after they had removed one of the sets of stairs. When we finally got onto the plane we found a lady sitting in our seat with a ticket for the very seat we had paid for. Not only did Ryanair representatives lie directly on a number of times to me they had sold the seat within 30 minutes of our first contacting them regarding the flight issue. My mother had to walk the entire length of the plane because the air hostess would not let her sit where she was supposed to sit. I will do everything in my power not to use Ryanair again.,Economy Class,n,2015-04-27,due fly back ireland husband two kid daughter contracted chickenpox contacted airline four day flight explained husband daughter would travelling u mother purchased another ticket would sitting husband seat think necessary paid additional fee sit seat chose wanted make sure mother journey stress free confirmed would fine got airport made sure still ok mother limited mobility find air travel extremely difficult confirmed kept seat paid got gate mother paid priority boarding stuff staff meant left waiting get onto plane removed one set stair finally got onto plane found lady sitting seat ticket seat paid ryanair representative lie directly number time sold seat within minute first contacting regarding flight issue mother walk entire length plane air hostess would let sit supposed sit everything power use ryanair,0.5729,Positive,821

1584,P Roberts,Ryanair baggage policy and terms are very clear but on recent flights there was evidence that it is enforced. On the flight out to Seville it took 30 minutes for the cabin crew to make space in the overhead lockers because of the number of oversized bags.

1585,A Clarke,"Over the past month I have been on four FR flights. The first two were short hops to the UK and back the first of which (to Manchester) the trolley service didn't even make it to me due to the short duration of the flight which I didn't really mind. The flight back from Bristol was a mess and possibly the hottest plane I've been on in quite a while. Overall the service wasn't too bad they left on time and popping cabin baggage into the hold at the last minute is a great idea really speeds up the boarding process once you're on board. Just back from Barcelona the flight over was as good as any but they ran out of certain items so one wonders what pax on the way back did for food and certain drinks and frankly the seat stays comfortable for just about the duration of the flight. Turns out I didn't have to wonder what the pax on the way back did there was barely even a bottle of water left on the plane I flew home on. The inflight service from the the back was incredibly slow which probably had something to do with the fact that the crew in this section clearly did not get along. This was maybe due to the lazy attitude of one of them who declared quite audibly that she wasn't walking back to the galley to fetch something as she ""couldn't be bothered"". I've been on a couple of FR flights in the past while where the cabin crew did not get along nor try to hide it at all which is something they could look at somehow.

1586,J Jones,Enjoyed a wonderful nine day break in Spain/Portugal. This whole break was marred by the Ryanair who think its acceptable to charge 140 euros for a two minute process of online check in which I had already done - funny how all our personal/passport details were already there along with the 'premium' seats I booked at the time of online checking in of our return flight. As we were in remote places with an old blackberry phone we were prepared to pay the still unreasonable boarding pass printing charge. Ryanair are in the position where they can hold you hostage until you pay.

1589,Cath Heys,After returning from Lanzarote yesterday with my family (3 generations) I was concerned about flying with Ryanair after all the bad press. However the flight time was good and the price was even better. I did pre-book seats as we were travelling with grandparents. The flight was ok. The crew were polite and helpful but despite offering an extensive 'cafe' service the only food available was a hot panini. As others have mentioned families were split as the flight was full then these people expected others to move so they could be together. I was not asked but others were annoyed. The flight was delayed and I lost count of the times the cabin crew and pilot stressed it was because of earlier problems at Manchester Airport not their fault.

1590,Eileen Kerrigan,"Four of us flew from Stansted (London) to Dublin on Good Friday April 3 2015. The gate crew and on-board crew were all friendly cheery and helpful the plane itself was surprisingly comfortable (muchmore comfortable than the United 757s we flew to/from Dublin the week before) and on-board food and beverage choices were decent and not horribly pricey. We departed promptly on time arrived on time and getting on/off was efficiently managed by the crew. Nearly everyone else on our flight was part of a huge school trip (kids about 12-14 plus their ""keepers"") and the crew members were great with the kids - kept them as organized as possible and were flexible about changing seat assignments so that friends could sit together - very nice to see! Here are the only two reasons I didn't give Ryanair an overall ""10"" rating: 1) I received mobile-phone alerts reminding me to do online check-in and get mobile boarding passes. Sounds easy enough but after four tries I was still unable to input our information - no explanation given. Finally on the fifth try it worked: I added all of the requested info (passport numbers etc.) for our party and then got a message saying ""We are unable to issue mobile boarding passes"" - again no explanation at all. Since I didn't have access to a computer or printer I began to panic especially after reading that there was a fee of 70 pounds per person to check in at the airport! Thank heavens our B&B owner came to the rescue and offered me the use of his personal computer and printer to complete the online check-in and print boarding passes. 2) We arrived at Stansted with more than two hours to spare before our flight got through security in record time and began checking the boards to see which gate we'd depart from. We sat down in the Coast to Coast restaurant to grab brunch while waiting all the while keeping an eye on the Departures board but out gate number wasn't posted until 15 minutes before departure time! Worse it turned out that our gate was a nearly 10-minute walk from the restaurant so all of on this flight had to do a mad dash for the gate at (almost) the last minute. I've never ever seen a gate number posted so late in the game especially when the gate was fairly far away - that was just baffling.

1610,M Seguin,As a non-EU passenger who lives in London UK I have to fill out a landing card whenever I am coming home. With any other airline landing cards are offered to persons like myself during the flight. This saves time filling it out later at customs. However they are never offered on Ryanair. On a recent flight home from Gdansk I decided to ask the crew for a card since I figured that they would not voluntarily offer one. The crew member stated that they would bring one and did bring me some sort of card which was half in Arabic half in French which appeared to be for passengers arriving in Morocco. It was completely different to the standard form. Later in the flight I spoke to another member of the crew about it pointing out that it was the wrong type of card. She giggled and mumbled something about hanging onto it 'just in case.' I pointed out that she was not making any sense. How hard would it be to carry some landing cards on the flight?

1611,Tom Smith,After a speedy boarding (as you'd expect from a budget airline) we went onto the plane. Inside was an eyesore. Bright yellow everywhere and everything was cheap and 'plasticy.' Bright horrible advert were everywhere - even seat backs - and you had to pay for a newspaper. The food was expensive and the service below average. The seats were cheap and flimsy and uncomfortable.

Never once did I see a smile from the two female crew and seemed to see passengers as a necessary evil of their daily job but the male steward was more approachable but he had a ticking off about something with the in-flight catering by a more senior stewardess in earshot of myself which was most unprofessional.

On the way back from Alicante Sunday 22 February we were pleasantly surprised to get through booking in speedily and then board all in good time. There was an announcement was that the plane was fully booked. We couldn't understand this as we were surrounded by empty seats. Then it was announced that they were waiting for some passengers who had been delayed. The next announcement was that the passengers were 70 Spanish schoolchildren. Eventually after 45 minutes after departure time the plane finally left. The landing and take-off resembled a roller coaster ride with much screaming and shouting.

1616,C Lloyd,Ryanair is the only airline that flies from Bournemouth direct to Malta so great so far as very local. However the purchasing of tickets is laborious and time consuming. The cost of the flights easily double should you reserve a seat (standard elsewhere) or want to stow luggage in the hold (standard elsewhere). The cabin crew were unbelievably poor and one even had a broken shoe ripped trousers un-ironed shirt and jacket and tie that was thrown on. Looked like he had been pulled through a hedge backwards - never seen anything like it.

The flight out was very busy and we were told at the gate that our cabin baggage would not be allowed in the cabin. However taking a small bag on board was not an issue so we could take books etc onto the aeroplane. The flight left STN around 20 minutes late which happens so arrived slightly late. However the return flight landed early. The cabin has enough space for me at 6 foot tall and despite being a four hour flight it was fine.

On all other flights being a small hop flight you can turn up an hour before the flight do a self-service confirmation get your ticket and get on a flight. I arrived an hour early and was told I had missed my flight! I asked the helpful airport staff and they directed me to the Ryanair desks. 50 minutes to go - no staff on any of the 5 desks. When I enquired further the airport staff told me that since I had not checked in on-line they had closed the flight. They would not be manning the desks again until 10 minutes after my flight left. They told me that even if I could have booked in on the self-service (Ryanair only) terminals I would have been charged an extra £60 for checking myself in. My advice?

I thought I would be able to do it when flying Norwegian but still could not access Ryanair website. I had 1 hour to get a boarding pass printed but after standing in line at the one Ryanair counter in Gatwick I had run out of time. Ryanair insisted I pay £70 for printing out a boarding pass.

The outbound trip was on time the return about half an hour late. Seats are not that comfortable but are bearable for short flights. It was worth paying the supplement for extra legroom seats and priority boarding. Staff on board were helpful and courteous Food purchased on board was ok and the coffee excellent.

Calculating a 5 hour delay I immediately asked to be disembarked - the capt responded immediately arranging stairs and ground crew. In minutes we were off with helpful crew around. As we entered the terminal the airport announced closure and the flight delayed by 90 minutes plus. Fact was it departed 4 hours 46 minutes later. We cancelled our seats.

We sat there and waited and waited but not once did any member of the cabin crew explain to us why we were still sitting there. Eventually after some considerable time we used our own initiative and used the exit at the back of the plane. At no time did the Ryanair staff say anything! So much for Health and Safety.

On the other side (for premium members?) there were 2 more employees but they were too busy giggling and messing around to consider taking a few passengers off the hands of the sole employee for economy. he was very friendly/quick and didn't seem at all jaded or phased that it was him vs 200 plus people. As I was in the front of the line my wait was short. The flight was full and everybody seemed to have carry on that well exceeded the limit so I was glad I paid the extra and checked my bag. Nobody was called out re succeeding the luggage limits so overhead space was at a premium but they got it all stowed. Cabin comfort was average and flight crew were pleasant enough.

1636,Barbara Norford,After spending Christmas with my family in Uberlingen Germany my husband and I struggled back to Memmingen Airport for the Ryanair flight back to Stansted on 27th December in freezing blizzard conditions and it was no surprise to us or other people waiting for the 14.40 Stansted flight that we were advised there was at least an hour's delay in the arrival of the Ryanair flight out of Stansted. Eventually it arrived and we were called to await boarding. We were then told to cross the tarmac to the plane for boarding. However when we reached the plane we were not allowed to board. There was a barrier over both entrances to the plane. The whole plane-load of passengers were kept outside on the tarmac in windy freezing conditions for about 15 minutes. There were babes in arms tiny children and elderly people standing outside a plane we had been given permission to board in freezing conditions. People in the queues were shouting to be allowed to board to no avail. When I returned home I wrote to Ryanair: requesting an explanation as to why passengers were called to board before the plane was ready when the plane was parked just outside the Airport buildings and also asking that the explanation be passed on to all adult passengers aboard that flight.

1638,U Kelly,Ryanair is fine to fly most of the time to get from A to B and if you can go hand luggage only. But that isn't always possible and today at Alicante the Bag Drop was pretty shambolic and stressful having to queue for more than an hour to drop off a case with people getting more and more frantic as the clock ticked by. It might have been because they had about 6 full flights scheduled one after another in a 2 hour period and only 3 desks for bag drop off. Plus they were charging everyone who was even just slightly over the weight which led to queues being at a stand still as people tried to rearrange their luggage or go and sort out the extra payments. If this is a frequent occurrence (will be watching as am a frequent flier) I will definitely avoid Ryanair as much as possible in the future. I will and have paid the premium for the extra business fare but the huge omission is that there is no priority drop off. Unlike Easyjet who give priority at bag drop if you have speedy boarding/easyjet plus. Makes the business fare bundle all a bit pointless since you have allocated seats anyway. If Ryanair introduced a priority drop-off as an optional extra I would happily pay it rather than stand in a queue for an hour.,Economy Class,n,2015-01-14,ryanair fine fly time get b go hand luggage always possible today alicante bag drop pretty shambolic stressful queue hour drop case people getting frantic clock ticked might full flight scheduled one another hour period desk bag drop plus charging everyone even slightly weight led queue stand still people tried rearrange luggage go sort extra payment frequent occurrence watching frequent flier definitely avoid ryanair much possible future paid premium extra business fare huge omission priority drop unlike easyjet give priority bag drop speedy boarding easyjet plus make business fare bundle bit pointless since allocated seat anyway ryanair introduced priority drop optional extra would happily pay rather stand queue hour,-0.6597,Negative,728

The online check-in cut-off time is arbitrary as it serves no purpose other than a deliberate tactic by Ryanair to extort additional funds from paying customers who at that point have no alternative but to pay and board the flight. We then were forced to wait in a crowded gate area and our flight departure was delayed by over an hour. During our time at the gate several Ryanair ""customer service"" agents made their way through the crowd demanding that some passengers must check their carry-on luggage. Almost every passenger with more than one carry-on item was ordered to leave their additional carry-on at the ground by the plane to load in to the hold. After making our way across the runway in freezing rain and snow we slowly made our way up the outdoor stairs to the plane only to be met with a surly male steward who was talking with a staff member instead of greeting passengers. All of the staff were rude and only spoke to passengers to ask to purchase items. Every item including water was provided only for a fee. We arrived in Milan only to be told that we had to sit on the plane to wait for a bus to take us to the terminal. One bus came and filled with passengers. We were in the back of the plane so we had to wait another long period for another bus. Bottom line - this was the worst travel experience in my 30 years of global travel. Yes the airline industry has changed significantly to cut costs and keep fares reasonable but there is no need to intentionally make customers feel worthless.

1643,J Dare,I have no issues with Ryanair. Given how cheap the tickets are I think the airline offers a good deal. Ok the seats aren't the most comfortable and the cabin crew are expected to sell sell sell but who cares. I can get to many European destinations for less than the price of a return train ticket to London (just 50 miles away from where I live). I am happy put up with a few minor inconveniences for deals like this.

1644,I Wallace,"My wife and I live in Spain and had booked a flight from Malaga to Stansted and a return flight from Stansted to Malaga some five weeks later. The night before our flight out of Malaga I duly went online to the Ryanair website to do the Online Check In. I filled in the flight details and submitted it then there was on option to print the Boarding Pass however I didn't have a printer my apartment so I assumed that since I had submitted the details all would be fine. This was not the case however. On arrival at Malaga Airport the next day we went to the Ryanair check in point that was at least 100 metres away from any other check in desk (probably so that other passengers could not hear any passenger complaints) We were asked for our Boarding Passes. I said that he had checked in online but had no way of printing the Boarding Pass. The Ryanair representative said that her computer was not showing that the Online Check In had been done. Although I insisted that I had submitted the Check In form online there was no way that I could prove it. The Ryanair Online Check In requires that the submit button is clicked on numerous times as it wants to sell extra luggage allowance hotels car hire and selected seats. If the submit button is not clicked on by-passing each of these selection options then the Online Check In does not go through. The Ryanair representative said that we would have to pay 70 Euros each for not submitting the Online Check In and for printing the Boarding Passes but as an alternative we were then told to take our laptop to the Ryanair Information Desk where they could have 15 minutes of free use of the Wi-Fi to find the details. The Wi-Fi was password protected however and the Ryanair staff member was not exactly showing any signs of wanting to help. I am of the opinion that it was extremely difficult if not impossible for a passenger to be able to retrieve the data. With time to board fast approaching we had no option but to pay 70 Euros each a Rip-Off total of 140 Euros to print two boarding passes.

1646,M Simons,Although some people had not spoken very well of Ryanair. I have the opposite to say. In both destinations in Athens and Stansted I found the staff very polite and very helpful. They were very organised and I was pleasantly surprised. The seats on the aeroplane were not too comfortable but for a short trip it didn't matter. The plus point was that travelling with a small child the arms of the seat lifted up and being flat it was easier for my daughter to sleep on the journey. The only down point that I could say is that the staff talking on the intercom I could not understand very well their English or Greek. This could have been a fault of the intercom. I found them excellent and compared to other airlines very competitive. It was the first time I had travelled with them and would do it again. I gave fair for value for money but that's because all flights from Greece to England are far too expensive.

1648,John Fairclough,BCN to STN return. I used to dread flying on Ryanair though in practice I had very little choice. The last year has seen a major improvement as a result of their charm offensive. Gone are the rugby scrums to get the best seats the petty case weighing and the inflexible enforcement of rules. Most of the recent flights I've been on (these two included) have been pretty full but there's been the opportunity to move to a less crowded section in spite of the usual 'not allowed due to weight and balance of the aircraft' nonsense trotted out by the purser at the start of the flight. I was surprised on the outbound sector that they used the jet way piers at BCN thereby loading from only the front door and rendering the boarding process rather chaotic and long-winded. First time I've ever seen this on a FR flight and you can see why they prefer a front and rear door approach. As always both flights were on time and it may just be that I've become immune to them but the intrusive sales related tannoy babble during the flight does seem to have been cut back. As others have said if you stay within their rules flying Ryanair can be reasonably pleasant these days.

1672,Crawford David,Paphos to Rome. FR 9697. October 31. Business Plus is a waste of money if there is a bus from the terminal to the plane since then one does not receive Priority Boarding. Also there is no Priority Deboarding so if one is in row 16/17 and there are exits front and rear then one is last off the plane and last at Passport Control. To be of value Business Plus passengers should always board first and deplane first.

I explained that I did not have access to a computer but that was no excuse - they said I would have to pay or I was not going anywhere. I had already paid 30 Euros for my piece of Luggage at time of booking so after paying and having requested wheelchair assistance on my original booking I was told to sit on a bench and wait. Eventually I was taken the departure gate only to be told after waiting 1/2 an hour and asking that the plane was 45 minutes late and would be leaving from a different gate. When we finally boarded - I did have priority boarding but that didn't seem to matter I had to walk across the tarmac to the plane and with much difficulty walk up the steps to the aircraft with my small carry on (I was not offered any assistance) to the last row.

1679,Leslie Cadwallader,"AGP - LPL. Usually fly with easyJet but Ryanair had a more convenient time for our return from Malaga. Had to pay for seats in order to print off boarding passes before leaving home so went the whole hog and paid for priority boarding as well. Didn't encounter any problems although the boarding agents did not arrive till 10 minutes before the gate was officially due to close. No checking of hand luggage dimensions nor application of ruling to allow first 90 bags only onboard as far as we could see so the last passengers to board were struggling to find locker space. Perhaps with a late night flight staff are more concerned about getting home as quickly as possible. Almost 15 minutes late taking off but made up time en route. Cabin crew were friendly and worked hard both helping passengers to stow bags and then later serving refreshments etc. Overall a relatively painless trip though not as relaxing as with easyJet. Minor gripes - the ""leather"" seats are rather unforgiving after a couple of hours and the announcements from the cabin and cockpit crew often difficult to hear as Ryanair's Boeings seem noisier than easyJet's Airbuses and crew tended to gabble anyway.",Economy Class,y,2014-10-28,agp lpl usually fly easyjet ryanair convenient time return malaga pay seat order print boarding pass leaving home went whole hog paid priority boarding well encounter problem although boarding agent arrive till minute gate officially due close checking hand luggage dimension application ruling allow first bag onboard far could see last passenger board struggling find locker space perhaps late night flight staff concerned getting home quickly possible almost minute late taking made time en route cabin crew friendly worked hard helping passenger stow bag later serving refreshment etc overall relatively painless trip though relaxing easyjet minor gripe leather seat rather unforgiving couple hour announcement cabin cockpit crew often difficult hear ryanair boeings seem noisier easyjet airbus crew tended gabble anyway,0.802,Positive,824

Found there are no better routes connecting SVQ and GOT/GSE these flights were the best option. As a point to point airline Ryanair never puts any responsibilities for any delays causing missed connections. We had a sharp 2 hrs at Paris to catch the next flight while the first flight from Seville was delayed a slightly over an hour due to extreme weather. You cannot expect a better pilot on SVQ-BVA route who was very informative and explained to us the delay causing him to change the parking three times and eventually used the airbridge. Flight from BVA was delayed allowing us to have an extra time. Return journey was fine. All in all very satisfied with the flights. We enjoyed both food along the way.

1681,J Walker,First and last experience with this airline. Outward flight from Leeds Bradford to Chania was OK and if it had been the same on the return flight then we would have flown with them again. Check in at Chania was an absolute shambles made worse by the fact I'd bought a bouzouki in Crete and was unaware of Ryanair's attitude to musical instruments. At the check in I was obliged to pay 60 Euro and had to have it placed in the hold. I accept the fact that a musical instrument can be a bit of a hazard on a plane but it would have easily have fitted in the overhead locker. None of the cabin crew on the return flight had English as a first language and were unable to offer me concise instruction on how I was to claim the instrument at Leeds Bradford. The menus were in Euros yet the cabin crew asked for payment in sterling with the inevitable delay whilst currency conversions were carried out. This slowed the catering service down so much that it wasn't worth bothering with. We paid extra for priority boarding although this does not seem to offer any priority at check-in and is a complete waste of time at Chania as staff try and make as much bonus as they can by finding oversize and overweight hand luggage. We were ignored by ground staff when we tried to use the Priority lane. It's a case of first come first served until one of the check in staff decides to stem the flow and call the priority passengers forward. We also paid a premium for extra legroom in row 16. The extra legroom was appreciated but the seats are very narrow with fixed armrests and were not very comfortable at all. Also the cabin crew are ruthless about loose items in that seat row and my wife was made to wear a cardigan she had on her lap until the aircraft had taken off. No doubt there will be many who are obliged to use this carrier to visit family or their holiday homes abroad and they will have obviously conditioned themselves to flying with Ryanair but I can assure you that so long as there is a choice we will not be repeating the experience.,Economy Class,n,2014-10-28,first last experience airline outward flight leeds bradford chania ok return flight would flown check chania absolute shamble made worse fact bought bouzouki crete unaware ryanair attitude musical instrument check obliged pay euro placed hold accept fact musical instrument bit hazard plane would easily fitted overhead locker none cabin crew return flight english first language unable offer concise instruction claim instrument leeds bradford menu euro yet cabin crew asked payment sterling inevitable delay whilst currency conversion carried slowed catering service much worth bothering paid extra priority boarding although seem offer priority check complete waste time chania staff try make much bonus finding oversize overweight hand luggage ignored ground staff tried use priority lane case first come first served one check staff decides stem flow call priority passenger forward also paid premium extra legroom row extra legroom appreciated seat narrow fixed armrest comfortable also cabin crew ruthless loose item seat row wife made wear cardigan lap aircraft taken doubt many obliged use carrier visit family holiday home abroad obviously conditioned flying ryanair assure long choice repeating experience,0.7096,Positive,1216

1687,R Singletary,Flew STN-CIA-STN with flights on time for both parts of the journey. Everything was what one might expect of a low cost carrier so no surprises there. However I missed my first flight due to 'visa check' procedures they require for those who are not EU/EEA citizens. Even though I did not require a visa for either of my destinations their insistence on this was not the real problem however but that they had so few agents working that this process took much longer than the security check on both legs of my journey. So it really spoiled my experience (especially in missing my first flight which then caused me to incur additional charges to get onto the next flight) simply because they did not have enough agents working. Additionally because they made such a fuss over 'checking visas' I would have assumed they would be able to provide UK arrival cards on-board since they would know non EU/EEA citizens need these as I've always done this with any other flight instead of having to fill one out after landing. They however did not have these on the return flight which meant I spent even more time at the UK immigration check simply because they did not have them.,Economy Class,n,2014-10-22,flew stn cia stn flight time part journey everything one might expect low cost carrier surprise however missed first flight due visa check procedure require eu eea citizen even though require visa either destination insistence real problem however agent working process took much longer security check leg journey really spoiled experience especially missing first flight caused incur additional charge get onto next flight simply enough agent working additionally made fuss checking visa would assumed would able provide uk arrival card board since would know non eu eea citizen need always done flight instead fill one landing however return flight meant spent even time uk immigration check simply,-0.6115,Negative,700

1701,Martina O'Shea,I am extremely dissatisfied with the service I received on the evening of 26th Sep in Wroclaw airport related to a Ryanair flight. I paid extra for priority boarding both to and from Wroclaw. We departed from Cork last Sunday night and all was fine apart from minor delays at the final door prior to leaving the airport to make our way to the plane. On the other hand the service that we received in Wroclaw was an absolute disgrace. Both myself and my friend were the third and fourth in the queue went through the first check in gates to go down to the foyer leading to the Tarmac and plane. The other q passengers then went through their check in procedure. We all were massed in this small foyer for approx 20 mins and then they decided to open the gates and push approx 6 different families with buggies on top of us. Needless to say it was absolute bedlam by the time the doors were finally opened. There was an elderly Polish lady who had also paid for priority boarding who was pushed out of the way with the stampede to get to the plane. They really need to look at your procedures around check in and boarding as I have never experienced anything like this before. I would suggest that people with buggies should be checked in first and that these then should be placed in the foyer. The next passengers to be checked in should be priority passengers as after all they have paid for the privilege of this service! Finally the passengers who are in the alternative queue should then be checked in. The door should be manned to ensure that priority passengers are treated fairly.,Economy Class,n,2014-10-05,extremely dissatisfied service received evening th sep wroclaw airport related ryanair flight paid extra priority boarding wroclaw departed cork last sunday night fine apart minor delay final door prior leaving airport make way plane hand service received wroclaw absolute disgrace friend third fourth queue went first check gate go foyer leading tarmac plane q passenger went check procedure massed small foyer approx min decided open gate push approx different family buggy top u needle say absolute bedlam time door finally opened elderly polish lady also paid priority boarding pushed way stampede get plane really need look procedure around check boarding never experienced anything like would suggest people buggy checked first placed foyer next passenger checked priority passenger paid privilege service finally passenger alternative queue checked door manned ensure priority passenger treated fairly,0.2016,Neutral,908
1702,K Curtis,When travelling from Palma to Stansted I had a broken foot and was on crutches. Myself and an elderly lady with hip problems had booked assistance which didn't materialise. Last on the plane we were told that a) the booking hadn't been made (even though we produced our booking papers) and b) there were no wheelchairs available and we had to make it to the terminal under our own steam. As the next set of passengers were queuing at the foot of the steps we felt compelled to get off. No staff took responsibility for us once we were on the tarmac.

1704,B Philpott,Actual flight both ways was good but the handling at Stansted and Rhodes wasn't. We felt like cattle not customers. Stansted we were held up getting to airport we had priority booking but had to wait with everyone else as priority queue had gone therefore one of the cabin bags had to go in the hold. At Rhodes we were first to check-in and they took the first 90 cabin bags in the hold. Surely it should be the last? There seems no reason now to take cabin bags at all! The benefit apart from the cost is that you can exit the airport much quicker at your destination. Waiting for cabin bags takes as long as waiting for large luggage. The overhead luggage compartments were half empty. It just seems like another Ryanair useless rule.,Economy Class,y,2014-10-05,actual flight way good handling stansted rhodes felt like cattle customer stansted held getting airport priority booking wait everyone else priority queue gone therefore one cabin bag go hold rhodes first check took first cabin bag hold surely last seems reason take cabin bag benefit apart cost exit airport much quicker destination waiting cabin bag take long waiting large luggage overhead luggage compartment half empty seems like another ryanair useless rule,0.8481,Positive,463
1705,M Hussey,Flew Ryanair many times however most common route I fly is KIR-LTN. Most recent flight SNN-SXF. Ryanair is a very good airline in my opinion. Despite flying to airports that only the CIA has heard of and advertising the airport for the capital city of Slovenia (it's Bratislava) as Vienna it's very handy. I use it often and I have never had a problem with Ryanair. Even with hidden fees tickets for me seem cheaper than Aer Lingus. The aircraft are clean but still somewhat dark and gloomy and the seats are uncomfortable horrible on a late-night flights or dawn when you try and catch some sleep however still possible. The snacks and drinks on board are still a reasonable price and the crew are friendly. The toilets are excellent being bright and clean.

1706,W Graham,Flight number FR694 on the 6th of September from Prestwick UK to Ibiza Spain. The majority of passengers onboard this drink fuelled flight were unruly drunken and aggressive towards other passengers despite the best efforts of the 4 onboard cabin crew. Language throughout was absolutely foul. As a grandmother travelling with 2 young infants under the age of four the condition experienced in the cabin were shocking. Passengers were swearing were drinking open duty free were throwing objects from in front and behind us. Safety announcements could not be heard as passengers were playing music from bluetooth devices and the cabin was totally out of control. Cabin crew were very concerned however despite the best efforts to contain behaviour there was no way they could control the passengers. The crew threatened to divert the aircraft to France and also threatened the majority of passengers with the police meeting them on arrival at the destination. The main point is that safety notices were completely ignored myself and my family felt totally unsafe during the flight. My grand-daughters aged two and three have never been exposed to such outrageous language and behaviour - the conditions on this flight were not safe and were not suitable for a family. Access to toilets involved standing for 40 minutes in crowds of alcohol fuelled louts. Many of the passengers boarded the flight inebriated one group drank a litre bottle of duty free vodka onboard the flight whilst throwing coins around the cabin. We are feeling extremely anxious about our return journey.,Economy Class,n,2014-10-05,flight number fr th september prestwick uk ibiza spain majority passenger onboard drink fuelled flight unruly drunken aggressive towards passenger despite best effort onboard cabin crew language throughout absolutely foul grandmother travelling young infant age four condition experienced cabin shocking passenger swearing drinking open duty free throwing object front behind u safety announcement could heard passenger playing music bluetooth device cabin totally control cabin crew concerned however despite best effort contain behaviour way could control passenger crew threatened divert aircraft france also threatened majority passenger police meeting arrival destination main point safety notice completely ignored family felt totally unsafe flight grand daughter aged two three never exposed outrageous language behaviour condition flight safe suitable family access toilet involved standing minute crowd alcohol fuelled lout many passenger boarded flight inebriated one group drank litre bottle duty free vodka onboard flight whilst throwing coin around cabin feeling extremely anxious return journey,0.1886,Neutral,1108
1707,Dionne Roberts,I have used Ryanair for years now sometimes 5 times per year in general and all is good. I booked a flight for my daughter and 2 year old granddaughter. When she left Shannon all was well until her return flight home from Tenerife. 6.30 am she checked in for the free allocation of seats they were allocated separate seats opposite side aisles. My daughter went early to the departures queue and boarded one of the first after priority boarding and explained to one of the crew they told her to take her seats and they would try to change her once they were in the air. I find this quite incredible for a flight to take off with a 2 year old baby sat on her own. Surely the crew have the option to change a free allocated seat but what amazes me more was Ryanair had all details as you have to register a child separately when booking.

1721,J G Stephenson,I fly Ryanair and easyjet to Malaga from Liverpool every 2 weeks and have done so for 2.5 years. The service from both is good and Ryanair are normally the cheapest. I have had 3 delays due to weather and one diversion to East Midlands last year due to the weather. I do hear complaints every now and then on flights for both airlines the majority by people who are not seasoned travellers and only fly on limited occasions. The complaints were mostly why cant I sit at the front because they see these seats are free but they are told you cant have these seats as the aircraft needs to be balanced. Most accept this others don't and they hold the queue up by arguing. Then you get the guy and his mate who hover around the extra leg room seats to see if they can get one and they block the aisles and hold the queue up. Now that allocated seating is on all aircraft these problems seem to be resolved apart from the odd idiot who says I want to sit next to my mate but we did not get that option when we booked so can you sort it this again holds the queue up. With regards to the aircraft staff yes they have their bad days but that is not surprising as they see the same type of idiots flying in and flying out. The expression you pay peanuts you get monkeys however does not apply to the majority of staff I have come across and the vast majority of regular travellers appreciate the stewards and the service they give.

1723,A Blackwell,Business plus plan: Smoke and Mirrors. I just went on a business trip and took the opportunity of travelling with Ryanair on their new Business plus plan. Just as an aside I fly regularly with Ryanair (no choice) and usually book and pay for all the options so I went for 'all the options' in a package that promised a 'bit' more and cost 70 euros more. The flight was from Dublin to Nice (France). The offering was 1) Flexibility on ticket changes 2) 20kg baggage allowance 3) Fast track airport security 4) Priority boarding and 5) Choose your premium seat. So this was all pretty good and I bought into it all. I did not need to use #1. #2 is standard. #3 I wanted and at Dublin Airport there was a gate for this that put us behind people being let into the fast lane for clearance (no big deal). When it came to the return flight this was not an option. #4 is standard. However at Nice everyone was let through the check in at the same time (there were two queues) and most priority passengers were way to the back of the ensueing melee - all were then herded aboard a couple of busses so no priority. #5 is standard.

1733,L Thompson,"Flew to Gran Canaria and had a perfect flight - lovely British cabin crew nothing too much trouble! On route home we arrived at Las Palmas airport to a queue as long as a football stadium of people. So we did as is British do and joined the queue they then waited ten minutes to open a second check in desk they then shouted people forward. The weigh scales where broke and so the queue grew and grew eventually after thirty minutes of entertaining a four year old we were up. We checked in and struggled with the ladies English which was broken at best but none the less she was polite. We then waited until our gate number was up and boarded the plane. Right from the start it was just one of those flights a family had checked in late so all ended up sat individually much to the fathers disgust as a result he allowed his two year old to scream the entire flight!

1739,P Cullen,I have flown Ryanair many times over the last few years and never really had a bad experience though it was clear they were pushing the low cost model to extremes. My most recent trip was the first since their change of direction and things have improved: best is reserved seats which makes boarding much more civilised the selling of food and other items seems lower key and the 'another on-time arrival' jingle is less irritating than it was - though I could still live without it. It is still a fairly basic service but not too dissimilar from that offered by other carriers on intra-European routes. Ryanair finally seems to be aware of what attracts customers apart from low fares and is addressing some of the issues I hope it continues.,Economy Class,y,2014-09-01,flown ryanair many time last year never really bad experience though clear pushing low cost model extreme recent trip first since change direction thing improved best reserved seat make boarding much civilised selling food item seems lower key another time arrival jingle le irritating though could still live without still fairly basic service dissimilar offered carrier intra european route ryanair finally seems aware attracts customer apart low fare addressing issue hope continues,0.8798,Positive,485
1740,Maria Elaine Cameron,FR5579 21 July returned 28 July on FR5578. My family and I travelled to Benidorm for 7 days. Our travel with Ryanair was less than perfect. On the flight over I ordered a small bottle of Prosecco the flight attendant went for ice and when she returned she knocked over the ice and in an attempt to catch it she knocked the bottle over which spilled over me. She did not apologise until about 15 minutes later and at the time she just picked up the bottle and said it is only a little amount. I had to get up and go to the bathroom to try and soak up some of the wine. Thankfully it was white wine. On our return flight I badly needed to go to the toilet the flight attendant was talking for a while with the co-pilot and finally I had to stand up. I was told from the toilet to sit down I was again told to sit as the co-pilot had to use the bathroom which he did however when he came out they again continued talking. I again stood up to be told sit again but this time she then indicated I use the rear toilet as the captain was to use the front facility also. (I was in row 9). As I approached the rear toilet the flight attendant there told me to go back to my seat I had to sit down the fasten your seatbelt sign was on I tried to explain and eventually stressed I had to use the toilet “now”. Then the attendant from the front called the rear and said to let me use the toilet which I did. The was very stressful especially in front of all the other people on board I do understand the need for safety on board a plane however the f act the staff have extended conversations amongst themselves as opposed to taking care of their paying clients speaks volumes.

1741,Meadows Sally,My experience of Ryanair was negative. The only saving grace for the company was the onboard staff particularly the chief steward who was polite friendly and helpful. The online booking I found absolutely puzzling. I travelled with Monarch on my outward journey which was straightforward and cheaper. As I was travelling around for a month beforehand the policy of having to print off the return boarding pass the week before you travel is ridiculous! The fact that if you can't do it you're charged is appalling! When I arrived to check in I was informed I had no baggage therefore I had to pay £35 more! The way I was told was very abrupt. My family with 2 young children had no seat allocation so had to wait for it to be sorted out. This despite having paid for the flight. Our checking in took in total over an hour!

1746,Anita Biressi,My journey from Stansted to Ibiza was ruined by drunken stag party members whose behaviour was completely disregarded by the air crew. It was evident from the beginning when the crew did a half-hearted safety demonstration that no-one had authority to run this flight. Passengers became increasingly distressed as the stag party shouted and swore aggressively ran up and down the aisles and openly drank from bottles of vodka while standing behind Ryanair staff. The crew evidently avoided eye contact no public announcements were made to warn them of the consequences and when I complained that the situation wasn't being managed staff simply ignored me. Although they did drag their feet bringing the trolley down the aisle they eventually served these men even more alcohol. This was a potentially very dangerous situation. On landing all of the men (aside from one who was incoherent and staggering) behaved perfectly properly as they exited through security to avoid arrest which suggests that they would have responded to warnings about their conduct during the flight.,Economy Class,n,2014-08-28,journey stansted ibiza ruined drunken stag party member whose behaviour completely disregarded air crew evident beginning crew half hearted safety demonstration one authority run flight passenger became increasingly distressed stag party shouted swore aggressively ran aisle openly drank bottle vodka standing behind ryanair staff crew evidently avoided eye contact public announcement made warn consequence complained situation managed staff simply ignored although drag foot bringing trolley aisle eventually served men even alcohol potentially dangerous situation landing men aside one incoherent staggering behaved perfectly properly exited security avoid arrest suggests would responded warning conduct flight,-0.908,Negative,714
1747,L Robertson,We have flown Ryanair many times without problems. If you know what to expect then you wont get disappointed. However upon arriving at East Midlands airport for our flight to Tenerife South recently with plenty of time to spare we found that there were 12 flights departing at roughly the same time. 12 flights of people that needed to check in and clear security before boarding. It seems that Ryanair just bung everyone together regardless of which flight you are on Some people were panicking as their flight was taking off soon and were stuck at check in when asked to jump the queue were told they would have to wait like everyone else! It took us 2 hours to get through check in and clear security. Queues were snaked round the airport (although admittedly this is not Ryanair's fault!) but a better system needs put in place for Ryanair check in. We managed to get to the boarding gates just in time albeit at the end of the queue. There we were kept waiting for 20 minutes as staff now needed hand luggage to put on the hold. The staff member was very aggressive and rude to us trying to grab our bags to put in the hold we told her that we needed the bags for inflight and one contained valuables that we wanted to keep with us. She tried to snatch my husbands backpack from his back and took my daughters small suitcase from her before I took it back. We eventually offered one bag but I had to remove everything that was needed and carry it in my hands she wouldn't even give us a carrier bag. She went up and down the last remaining passengers trying to grab peoples hand luggage but as nobody else would offer a bag she came back to us telling us she needed our bags we refused but She wasn't having any of it and barked at us we didn't have a choice as we were at the end of the queue and if we didn't put our hand luggage in the hold we would be fined £60. Her attitude was appalling and if she'd have asked politely we may have tried our best to accommodate her request. She wouldn't let the last people through the departure gate thus holding up the flight until she had the bags But no way were we giving up our remaining (small) bags. We eventually got on the bus to the plane and on the flight there we sat for another 20 minutes before actually taking off! It was never made clear that only the first 60 passengers were guaranteed to take their hand luggage. Yet on our return flight home everything was smooth queues moved quickly and staff were very pleasant helpful and polite. We packed our bags accordingly and offered our hand luggage for the hold.

The only thing I would do is remove the garish yellow. But that's a matter of taste. Ultimately exceeded my expectations so kudos to Ryanair.

1750,S Smyth,I use Ryanair regularly flying from Dublin to the Netherlands. You get what you pay for. Fast boarding a flight with reasonable service and quickly into the terminal once the plane has arrived. The staff aren't particularly friendly and clearly look as if they are under pressure for the entire flight. Upon reaching the gate the flight attendants have often told passengers that they only have 20 minutes to get the plane turned around and to get off quickly once the doors are opened. This often leads to a push when getting off. To avoid this I remain seated until people have started getting off. Because of the short turn around time it isn't unusual to find some else's rubbish in your seat pocket however flight attendants do go round with a rubbish bag before the end of the flight so it's caused by inconsiderate passengers rather than the airline. Overall if you just want to get there on time and you are not concerned about the service fly Ryanair.,Economy Class,n,2014-08-26,use ryanair regularly flying dublin netherlands get pay fast boarding flight reasonable service quickly terminal plane arrived staff particularly friendly clearly look pressure entire flight upon reaching gate flight attendant often told passenger minute get plane turned around get quickly door opened often lead push getting avoid remain seated people started getting short turn around time unusual find else rubbish seat pocket however flight attendant go round rubbish bag end flight caused inconsiderate passenger rather airline overall want get time concerned service fly ryanair,0.2195,Neutral,585

After arriving at Stansted 3 hours before the flight was due to depart we arrived at the boarding gate during final flight call. Why? Because of the throng of people Ryanair euphemistically call a queue attempting to check- in their bags at their bag-drops manned by the Ryanair Gestapo. It appears these rude unhelpful staff's main training was on extracting extra cash wherever it is physically possible. To watch so many people removing items from hold bags only to add them to their cabin luggage is farcical. Or would be if it wasn't so sad. In my own case my bag was 5kg under and my travelling partner's was nearly 1kg over. No problem you would think there is still a net difference of -4kg. But no as the tickets weren't booked on the same reference number we were deemed to be travelling separately. Even though we had booked seat numbers next to each other and paid the extra we were still flying separately according to the misery behind the counter. Ok so it's no real effort to undo her bag remove a few bits and put them into the bag you are going to take into the cabin with you. But multiply that with the amount of people doing the same and you soon end up with massive queues. And both bags are going onto the plane anyway! Fortunately flying back was with EasyJet who managed the same procedure in less than 15 minutes. I know who I will always use in the future.,Economy Class,n,2014-08-20,airline continues show interest customer service staff training bottom line arriving stansted hour flight due depart arrived boarding gate final flight call throng people ryanair euphemistically call queue attempting check bag bag drop manned ryanair gestapo appears rude unhelpful staff main training extracting extra cash wherever physically possible watch many people removing item hold bag add cabin luggage farcical would sad case bag kg travelling partner nearly kg problem would think still net difference kg ticket booked reference number deemed travelling separately even though booked seat number next paid extra still flying separately according misery behind counter ok real effort undo bag remove bit put bag going take cabin multiply amount people soon end massive queue bag going onto plane anyway fortunately flying back easyjet managed procedure le minute know always use future,-0.8316,Negative,895

There are no advertisements on the overhead bins and there where no scratch cards. An ok trolley came with food for sale. OK priced. Better than the airport. We landed 15mins early and no fanfare?

But it means I visit my house in Portugal regularly and often pay more for the car parking than the flight.,Economy Class,y,2014-08-15,fly ryanair time year consistently reliable punctual time let ash cloud happened price fantastic flexible get best deal ba need mind set like catching train expect luxury mean visit house portugal regularly often pay car parking flight,0.8957,Positive,235

So what do they tell you? - ""If you want to guarantee to have your hand luggage with you on the plane then you should pay for priority boarding"". So in effect you are being charged for having your bag with you. I am a regular traveller so don't take hold luggage to avoid the waiting at the destination. The small bag allocation is insufficient so I rely on the hand luggage. There is a hand luggage locker for every seat on the plane so how can they justify ""first 60 only""?

All flights were late leaving but made up time except for the Poitiers- Stansted leg which was delayed by 1 hour due to a passenger injury at boarding time. My only gripe is that I had booked a Shannon-Nantes flight and Hertz car hire in January. Ryanair cancelled the Nantes fight in May offering a flight to Poitiers or money back. Transfer went very smoothly. However Hertz told me that they did not have an office in Poitiers and my only option was to cancel which I did only to be charged a 50 euro cancellation fee even though I had booked through Ryanair.

I would put them above Easjet for that fact alone. Had a lovely Spanish crew on the return journey and the flight arrived slightly ahead of schedule. As others have said as long as you follow their strict rules on baggage and boarding passes there should not be a problem. I booked priority boarding for both journeys as it helps with the children to not have too long a queue and sort out seats and luggage before the plane becomes packed.,Economy Class,y,2014-08-14,took flight family adult child stansted alicante back first time taking hand luggage ryanair used easyjet may ryanair allow handbag made whole process much easier would put easjet fact alone lovely spanish crew return journey flight arrived slightly ahead schedule others said long follow strict rule baggage boarding pass problem booked priority boarding journey help child long queue sort seat luggage plane becomes packed,0.8658,Positive,424
1769,Eelco van den Heuvel,Dortmund-Krakow RTN. Avoided Ryanair because of their aggressive policy but decided to give them a try again. Finally Ryanair has understood that free seating leading to a scrum has had its longest time. The allocated seating for decent fees is a big improvement. Onboard only harassed once for a lottery. No constant announcements for buying this and that anymore. Leg room stays a problem though as they press 198 passengers into a Boeing 737-800. Wouldn't bear a FR-flight longer than two hours. All in all a decent experience for less than 200 euro rtn for two including bag priority boarding - worked well but isn't really necessary anymore with allocated seating - and reserved seat. If you reserve a seat at the time of booking you can can check in 30 days prior to departure.

Then for almost 2/3 hrs we were told different stories about what was happening. It turned out that the plane required full checks before flying why oh why couldn't we have had the truth up front. We were herded together like cattle in departure with no air conditioning no drinks were offered for the children until just as we boarded. On the positive our hold case was brought through to us so my husband could get his medication. In fairness my husband and I were assisted by a lovely lady who fast tracked us through as we were both struggling with the long walk and queues through the checks both having mobility problems.

1771,I Stevenson,Flew Edin-Malta-Edin with my 5 year old son for 7 days and so was unable to print off return boarding pass before arriving in Malta. There are no internet cafes in Sliema Malta so thought would print off boarding pass at machine at the airport. On arriving at Malta airport 2 hours 20 minutes before my flight a particularly grumpy Ryanair agent took up 10 minutes of my time telling me I was too late and should have done this in Malta (How exactly if there are no internet cafes and you do not stay in a hotel?) before finally pointing me towards the computer where I could do this. This touchscreen computer was slow and unresponsive and so I was 2 minutes late to meet the 2 hour deadline because of this woman's complete lack of customer service. An EUR 140 fee and a horrible stressful end to the holiday. What gets me is that I knew I had to print the boarding pass off 2 hours before and made a fair effort to do so leaving 20 minutes to do this on arrival at the airport. I noticed Lufthansa had dedicated machines clearly visible for this purpose. I had to beg this woman to tell me where was the Ryan Air machine before she pointed it out to me all the while telling me I was too late etc when I still had time. However reading other reviews it looks as if even if I had been at the airport much earlier that the fee might still have been charged. I am sure they can afford to install these with all the EUR 70 fees they have been stashing away this summer.,Economy Class,n,2014-08-08,flew edin malta edin year old son day unable print return boarding pas arriving malta internet cafe sliema malta thought would print boarding pas machine airport arriving malta airport hour minute flight particularly grumpy ryanair agent took minute time telling late done malta exactly internet cafe stay hotel finally pointing towards computer could touchscreen computer slow unresponsive minute late meet hour deadline woman complete lack customer service eur fee horrible stressful end holiday get knew print boarding pas hour made fair effort leaving minute arrival airport noticed lufthansa dedicated machine clearly visible purpose beg woman tell ryan air machine pointed telling late etc still time however reading review look even airport much earlier fee might still charged sure afford install eur fee stashing away summer,0.2732,Neutral,833
1772,Freer Christa,London (Stansted) to Bremen (Germany) return. Beware of Ryanair suitcase check-in/drop off unless you want to risk missing your flight. Checked-in online with only a trundle. Drove from Leicester to Stansted. Arrived 2 hours before the flight and were met with chaos as my niece (on same flight with us) who had come to visit needed to drop off her suitcase (also already checked-in online). Passengers of numerous flights had all been lumped together into one disorientated heap of people with check-in operating at slow pace. The usual clue as to the destination above the relevant individual check-in desks was not there and was replaced by one single queue/lump of chaos. One distraught couple told me that they had already been queuing for 40 minutes at the wrong Ryanair desk round the corner. I asked a passing Ryanair staff if we were in the right queue (although it was hard to describe it as such) and pointed out that our flight was about to close. He confirmed we were. 15 minutes later he asked passengers for the Bremen flight to come forward. Our flight had already closed whilst at security which was as chaotic. Mercifully the flight was late taking off. I have never experienced in all my years of travelling to all the continents on the globe such chaos stress and anxiety. There was nothing leisurely about this trip. We had to run (it was very hot) all the way through corridors and shops only to be met by a train (not a gate) taking us to the gates. We were lucky that our gate was in the thirties not seventies as we would have missed our flight for sure. In the end we arrived breathless hot and sweating in front of another lump/queue of passengers with just enough time to use the toilet. I should also mention that the word priority on your check-in paper does not mean a thing.

However family holiday to Lanzarote and the only people flying out in the morning (so we arrive before lunch) was Ryanair. So I hesitantly booked (even though it was no cheaper than the other airlines). First came the con where you can no longer print your boarding passes (unless you have paid the extra for allocated seating) until 14 days before you return date. As this was a 2 week holiday I was already at the airport catching my flight out so had to pay for allocated seating. This was just a snippet of what was to come. The flight out was cattle market heaven but quite uneventful so consoled myself with the fact that I had done the right thing and would have an extra half day holiday by flying out early. The flight home was the nightmare we were called to our gate then the gate changed twice so the long queue of people were already irate when there was a general murmur around the crowd. This was when the first person had received a text to say the flight had been delayed due to technical issues and we had a delay of over 5 hours. Not told anything by the staff on the ground the whole airport became Chinese whispers. In total I had 4 texts from Ryanair delaying the flight eventually by 12 hours. We did not arrive home until 5am. I feel like I now need another holiday after spending 15 hours in a very hot uncomfortable airport and then a further 4 hour flight home.,Economy Class,n,2014-07-27,flight fr number never forget nd time ryanair first time although real problem felt like treated second class citizen vowed never book however family holiday lanzarote people flying morning arrive lunch ryanair hesitantly booked even though cheaper airline first came con longer print boarding pass unless paid extra allocated seating day return date week holiday already airport catching flight pay allocated seating snippet come flight cattle market heaven quite uneventful consoled fact done right thing would extra half day holiday flying early flight home nightmare called gate gate changed twice long queue people already irate general murmur around crowd first person received text say flight delayed due technical issue delay hour told anything staff ground whole airport became chinese whisper total text ryanair delaying flight eventually hour arrive home feel like need another holiday spending hour hot uncomfortable airport hour flight home,0.6207,Positive,953

1793,S Walsgrove,Ryanair does not allow you to get boarding passes for the return flights straightforwardly at the same time as for the outward flight although within the 30 day period. This resulted in a £70 charge for each of our return flights. A lot of people seem to have been caught out by this see other reviews. This seems to be a new practice and I could not recommend Ryanair to anyone in future since there is a real risk that their holiday will be ruined as a result of this disgusting sharp practice.

1795,Hall Lawrie,Having been put off using Ryanair about 4 years ago I took a flight from Bristol to Girona and return early July 2014. I was well aware of all the pitfalls and extra charges and then made the mistake of mis-spelling my own first name. I thought 'here we go' especially as I couldn't get through on the phone even the £1.09 a minute line. Then I stumbled upon their 'live chat' facility got connected within 2 minutes and had the name corrected. They emailed me a revised confirmation. Of the flights - well the pre-allocated seats are a great improvement - saves that awful scramble on board with the FAs screaming 'if you don't sit down we'll lose our flight slot' and passengers coming to blows. The boarding pass saying front or rear of the plane is sensible. Unlike previous flights (which was what finally put me off Ryanair) there were no cases either at BRS or GRO of passengers being harassed having their luggage weighed or measured or any sign of people being charged for things. Most notably I didn't hear any passengers grumbling about anything. So the simple impression of just 2 flights is that you get what you pay for on-time clean planes and a vast improvement from 4 (plus) years ago.

The tickets sounded like a great deal until we got to the airport and found out we had to pay another $140 euro for boarding passes. The rep at the counter all of a sudden did not speak English or Spanish was rude and started to roll her eyes. We paid the additional charge and went back to check our luggage. We then were told there were more charges for our bag (under weight) that were not included apparently. We paid the extra fees and finally were told we could get in line. We proceeded to get in line which was a huge disaster and with no logic or system in place or completely poorly executed and took 2 hours. The lines began to severely back up they began shifting customers back and forth between lines and ultimately the plane had to leave late. Once on the plane the conditions and cleanliness of the plane were noticeably lacking and even a few pieces were broken. Refreshments were offered at unreasonable prices. The pilot must have been new because the entire flight was filled with drastic turns turbulence and ultimately. We couldn't wait to get off the plane. We had to wait another 45 minutes in baggage claim before our luggage began to roll.

Very much appreciated considering it was not their fault I missed the flight.

This along with the various upgrades to their service in the past 12 months (additional carry on bag reserved seating etc) have made Ryanair my choice of airline when flying from London. Customer service is dramatically improving in my opinion and as long as you know how they operate and how the pricing structure works then there shouldn't be any issues when flying with them.

1805,Van Daele Pieter-Jan,We went with 6 people (4 adults and 2 children). We accidentally had two pieces of luggage too much (this was our own fault) so we paid the extra other airlines do the same so its not just Ryanair. Boarding was very smooth and the children received special attention from a friendly crew member. Plane landed on time in Rome. Return was about the same. I fly regularly with Ryanair and I never had any problems. Delays are hardly the mistake of the airline but of the airport and the airport handling so you cannot blame them for that. Also people flying with Ryanair don't want to pay much for their tickets but they complain about the people paying the extras like priority boarding. Some passengers not paying for the extras were complaining why we could get on first! Also if you preselect your seat with a small extra you can print your boarding pass (also for the return flight) at home. Even with all the extras Ryanair was the cheapest solution. So to be frankly not Ryanair is the problem but some people flying with Ryanair are. Ryanair is very clear about their rules and I really don't understand why people don't obbey them? Do they do it on purpose maybe hoping they get the full service and not paying for it? I like Ryanair they bring you very safely from A to B for very little money.

1818,I Migle,Round trip Kaunas (KUN) - London Gatwick (LGW) - Kaunas (KUN). Friendly staff flight with no errors or other shenanigans. Not much space to move around in the plane itself but acceptable for short haul flights. One disadvantage - everything costs money. I'm surprised they still don't charge for bathroom trips. Of course you can only expect so much from a low price airline which is the main advantage. Another thing is the flight attendants trying to sell lottery tickets and calendars that is rather unprofessional feels like you're in a market or someplace similar.

1819,R White,"If anyone is every considering flying with Ryanair ensure you know exactly what experience you are signing up for when you book your ticket. We went return from Luton to Marrakech and would not do this journey with them again. In fact we'd only think about it for very short flights for weekend breaks and to be honest that would be pretty desperate. Where to start? They may offer cheaper ""upfront"" costs but add-ons are extortionate. The fact you cannot print off your return boarding pass within 7 days of your return flight is just a way to con people out of the money (£10 per person) to advance purchase a designated seat. After all who wants to gallivant around an unfamiliar foreign city looking for an internet cafe that may or may not have a printer. The queuing is still a scrum even though they have finally realised that assigning people seats will stop the kind of behaviour they and their ilk were responsible for creating. On the flight the whole experience is stuffy cramped and bad tempered. The hard-sell starts instantly and continues through the whole flight. The claustrophobic atmosphere is taken further by the fact that some aisles didn't even have windows! They couldn't even be bothered to give out landing cards either which just prolonged the bad experience at the airport. I reckon that after all the add-ons it would have been cheaper to fly with BA.

1820,R Calcutt-Saunders,22/6/2014. Flying from Stansted to Treviso Venice for 7 days holiday we were fine on our outward journey as we had been able to check-in and print off the boarding passes however the system would allow us to do the same for our return at that point in time. Where we were staying we had no access to a computer or printer but assumed perhaps foolishly that at Treviso airport they would have the same system as they do in Stansted and we would be able to check-in and print off at their machines for a nominal fee. How wrong we were. We arrived well before the 2 hour time scale but ended having to pay additional 140 Euros! Money making at its worse I feel very sorry for the staff at the check in desks whilst we were there I saw at least another 2 people who were in the same position as we were. It wasn't until I got home I saw the email from Ryanair advising of the additional costs. I received a text message at 23.00 the night before our departure at 9.50 reminding us we needed to check-in and print off the boarding card if they had notified me in this text of the astronomical charge awaiting us at the airport we would have search around the entire city of Venice for someone to assist us but it wasn't included!

He then tried to fit mine which contained a laptop Ipad and Kindle into a separate overhead by cramming it in. I finally had to yell at him to stop to which he complained my bag was too large to fit.

We reserved online paid with credit card got an email that it's been confirmed. So we were hoping that it will be an easy check in since we came two hours early. We were told at the airport that we should have checked in online and that the payment was forfeited so we had to pay again for the same flight. In addition we had to pay 40 Euros each for our luggage since only 2 small carry ons were allowed. Since we had to go on that flight we had no recourse but to give in.

1825,A Fiddies,Flew Manchester-Gran Canaria. Good flight times and got baggage quickly. Attempting to print off the boarding pass scam was painful to say the least. In the UK the site kept crashing and took the best part of a day to achieve the process only to have to repeat this in our holiday destination. When at Manchester airport it was displayed that boarding for our flight was in 5 minutes this continued for about 25 minutes with no updates. We were then requested to proceed to boarding that I can only explain as a cattle market. We were then left to wait in the queue for the best part of another 45 minutes. Consequently our flight was delayed by well over an hour with no explanation or apology. Whilst on the flight to Gran Canaria the seat belt sign light was displayed intermittently for long periods with no evidence of turbulence or explanation. Being 2 adults we could manage this but we had to feel for the passengers with young children who desperately wanted the toilet. Baggage - the allowance is 15 kilos for hold luggage and 10 for hand luggage. When we flew out from Manchester they counted hand luggage in our allowance. On return from Gran Canaria they decided that hold luggage should only be 15 kilos. Our hold luggage weighed exactly the same as it did at Manchester and we did not have hand luggage but were told that it would cost us 70 euros to pay the excess. Having very little hand luggage facilities available we had to empty our case to avoid the excess charge. Admittedly we should have read the small print but one would question why this was not highlighted in Manchester and came to light in Gran Canaria on our return. Overall it may be a budget airline but really not worth the hassle.,Economy Class,n,2014-06-18,flew manchester gran canaria good flight time got baggage quickly attempting print boarding pas scam painful say least uk site kept crashing took best part day achieve process repeat holiday destination manchester airport displayed boarding flight minute continued minute update requested proceed boarding explain cattle market left wait queue best part another minute consequently flight delayed well hour explanation apology whilst flight gran canaria seat belt sign light displayed intermittently long period evidence turbulence explanation adult could manage feel passenger young child desperately wanted toilet baggage allowance kilo hold luggage hand luggage flew manchester counted hand luggage allowance return gran canaria decided hold luggage kilo hold luggage weighed exactly manchester hand luggage told would cost u euro pay excess little hand luggage facility available empty case avoid excess charge admittedly read small print one would question highlighted manchester came light gran canaria return overall may budget airline really worth hassle,0.9477,Positive,1062
1826,John Palmer,We travelled twice with Ryanair during the last week. The first trip (Stansted to Pisa) was delayed 45 minutes. Its not so much the delay that's the problem it is the total lack of communication or an apology for the late running. We were asked to queue up for boarding and stood there for over an hour with no communication. Worse was to follow. On the following Saturday we were booked on the 22.00 flight out of Pisa for Stansted. Again no communication or apologies were forthcoming from Ryanair. 150 minutes after the flight should have left we were told it was cancelled - no apology again. We were not offered any refreshment during this three hours. They then booked the passengers a hotel but had only a mini bus to start with to take 16 passengers a time randomly selected by Ryanair staff. We eventually arrived at the hotel at 03.00 but had to be up for an 07.00 departure from the hotel. No food or drinks were offered by Ryanair. No staff were available at Pisa airport to speak to or to hand out vouchers. The service was shabby at best. No apologies poor communication no-one to talk too and no refreshment vouchers either.

This meant checking in at the airport for the sum of £70 per head (£140 in total) for myself and my wife. I completely understand the argument of a web based airline and would expect to have to pay extra for the privilege but those sort of charges are punitive and unfortunately destroy the more customer focused marketing approach Ryanair are trying - a shame!,Economy Class,n,2014-05-28,flight time birmingham barcelona worked along cost flight recently seen ryanair marketing campaign make customer friendly felt time try made mistake checking online realised company policy time tried two hour curfew meant checking airport sum per head total wife completely understand argument web based airline would expect pay extra privilege sort charge punitive unfortunately destroy customer focused marketing approach ryanair trying shame,-0.8617,Negative,444

1852,D Gazal,I would not recommend Ryanair. I recently flew from Paris to Barcelona with my wife. We were hoping to save a few dollars by flying this cheap airline. We paid for it. First airport where they fly out of is about 80km from Paris so you will pay extra to get there and it will cost you time. Then when you get there be prepared to pay 10 euros for every kilo overweight (max 20 kilos per checked bag most airlines give 25 kilos per checked bag). Finally don't forget to print your boarding pass because if you don't you will pay 70 euros per person for them to do it at the airport (this was twice as much as the actual ticket).

1856,B Thompson,Use of Ryanair is generally a last resort. Flight last Friday from Treviso to Bristol was due to take off at 15:20 but about 30mins beforehand a small storm arrived with torrential rain and lightning meant there was likely to be some delay. However passengers were still gathered around the very small and enclosed gate area as normal and only at departure time was the board updated to show an hour delay. Everyone including several disabled passengers in wheelchairs stayed expecting aircraft arrival and loading as indicated. The storm had passed and other aircraft were moving. No further updates were given and an hour later a further hour delay was updated on the gate display. With no seating for most passengers no refreshments and no information people were becoming unhappy especially as another delayed flight were packed into the same space. When the third hour delay was put up on the display it was accompanied by advice notices for passengers advising of EU travel rights! When the plane eventually arrived just before the third hour of delay and passengers allowed to board the crew were more concerned with making sure we were aware they were due to be off duty soon - no word of any apology for delay from anyone. Part way into the flight back it was then announced the crew was at their limit of allowed flight time and we would be diverted into Brussels for a new crew to board. On landing no crew but another hour wait for them to be roused from homes to take over the flight. Why the operations staff did not allow for this originally is not known!

Placed a booking Ryanair changed the rules between the time I placed my booking and date of flying which meant they expect me to receive return flight boarding cards by email whilst on holiday and then try to get the hotel to print them out for me.

We got an email from Ryanair a few hours before departure saying the flight had been cancelled without stating any reason whatsoever. We tried calling the Ryanair hotline to no avail.

There were no flights on the same day or the following day from any Milan airport. We had to commute to Milan Malpensa to buy expensive alternate flights to Budapest with an overnight connection at Warsaw. Ryanair is an absolute nightmare of an airline.

1863,V Gee,Me and 5 other girls flew Ryanair from Manchester to Tenerife and back again on May 9th 2014. Overall not too bad I guess for a budget airline but the new introduction of the 7 day boarding pass malarkey meant we were stung on the return flight for 70 euros. As this is on the return flight we had obviously spent up and had to contact one of the groups husbands to ask if we cold charge to his credit card to get us home. At no point was this new procedure explained to us (and yes I appreciate it is probably in the very small print but if you are a regular flyer with Ryanair (which the girl who booked was) you would expect something like this to at least be mentioned when you book) and I can in no way begin to fathom how they can justify 70 euros. It is simple case of robbery and Ryanair should be ashamed of themselves. We were by no means the only people caught out with this phenomenal fee and it certainly feels like you are being held to ransom. Another peev was that when we boarded some people had to put their hand luggage in the checked in luggage area as we were told there was no room in the above holders - lie! They were nearly empty.

1868,Sonora Chen,I don't appreciate their staff service before boarding. In my experience when I was leaving from Birmingham for Barcelona I was requested to put my cabin luggage into the sizer without reminding. Since my luggage which its design is flexible and there are two rows of zippers at that moment it was not suitable for the sizer. I said I can try to make it smaller but there were three staff crowed to me and threatened me they didn't have time to let me organise my items and charge me the penalty immediately. Their attitudes were like robbers and I didn't have any options then because there was nobody beside me. Actually when I returned from Barcelona the same luggage and there were even more items inside but I've used a belt to tie it up. Therefore the length is much less than 20 cm and it perfectly fit the sizer. Due to the delayed flight every passenger was on board without any checking size of their baggage when I left form Barcelona for Birmingham I've also noticed that most of the suitcases were much larger than me but nobody was requested for penalty. I understand terms and conditions of Ryanair in advance. But what a shame the attitude of Ryanair’staff made is unpleasant and 50 pound is not a small fee for me. How come they charged it without any warning (If I could have one more minute to organise my suitcase.) before boarding especially originally I've been tagged the yellow label in the queue however they changed their mind and enforced me when there were no other customers at the boarding gate.

1883,Daniel Webb,Although personally I prefer Easyjet and think the service is better everybody on here moaning about various issues / things to do with Ryanair need to realise they're booking a flight on a budget airline which can be priced at 20% of the cost of flying with a national carrier such as BA or KLM or other tour operator airlines such as Monarch Thomas Cook or TUI only if booked at the right time. People moaning about not being able to print boarding passes or check in for more than a week in advance should book reserved seating on the aircraft this allows you to check in and print boarding passes for the following 30 days! Ryanair makes it's profits from various add ons - i.e baggage seat allocation expensive food/drinks. Once all this is added the difference in cost with booking with another airline is still substantial. I am flying to Gran Canaria next week for which I have paid £106.48 return including the added seat allocation reservation. I checked in for both flights on the 17th April. I shall be taking a sandwich onto the flight which will saved me paying £6 for a tasteless one from Ryanair I'll even take a soft drink on board. When booking my flight I had the option to fly Thomas Cook Norwegian Air or Jet2 on the days I wanted to travel - however all 3 were over £300!

1889,F Gong,On 15th Sept 2013 we four people from Australia after visiting beautiful Paris went to Paris Beauvais airport to catch 9:20 am flight (FR9632) to Rome. All were checked in online the night before in the Hotel we stayed. However boarding passes were not printed out as per instruction in the email from the airline. a mistake was made by us. At the check-in counter we were told EURO 70 per person would be charged if no boarding pass was presented. We could not believe it in the first instance but later were confirmed by his duty manager. We do not believe that EURO 70 for printing a boarding pass is justifiable by any standard. It is in fact more than the airfare itself and more than the fee for an extra luggage (EURO 60). While we accept the error we made the punishment was well beyond anyone's imagination hence it is not reasonable and not justifiable. We felt like being robbed on highway with no way to escape. And we still do. We must point out that the check-in gentleman was kind enough to show us a self-serving Internet kiosk/access point where printing was available. Unfortunately after tried on two computers with loss of a total of EURO 20 worth of coins and notes we went back to the counter and tried to request for printing at a fair and reasonable cost. The second complaint is about the way in which the duty manager a lady handled our request for help. She was arrogant in our view. Having heard of our explanation she showed no sympathy but said it was the company policy and we either pay or do not fly today. The fact that we could not print out the passes at the computer kiosk did not bother her at all because it was someone else's equipment hence nothing to do with her.,Economy Class,n,2014-04-30,th sept four people australia visiting beautiful paris went paris beauvais airport catch flight fr rome checked online night hotel stayed however boarding pass printed per instruction email airline mistake made u check counter told euro per person would charged boarding pas presented could believe first instance later confirmed duty manager believe euro printing boarding pas justifiable standard fact airfare fee extra luggage euro accept error made punishment well beyond anyone imagination hence reasonable justifiable felt like robbed highway way escape still must point check gentleman kind enough show u self serving internet kiosk access point printing available unfortunately tried two computer loss total euro worth coin note went back counter tried request printing fair reasonable cost second complaint way duty manager lady handled request help arrogant view heard explanation showed sympathy said company policy either pay fly today fact could print pass computer kiosk bother someone else equipment hence nothing,0.4364,Neutral,1028

The website would not accept our booking reference. We assumed we would be able to just print our boarding passes at check-in like any other normal airline. Instead we were told that it didn't matter that we experienced issues online. Ryanair policy states that we now had to pay £70 per head flying regardless of our circumstances otherwise we would be left in Mallorca. This amounted to £210 for my wife daughter and I. The saga did not end there the lady at the Ryanair desk decided it was a good idea to sit a family travelling with a 3 year old completely separately. My daughter - 16F my wife - 17C and me in 16C. We were flying on one of their Boeing 737-800 aircraft and that rows 16 and 17 are exit rows.

I had no access to internet whilst on holiday (which is the way most people want it as they are on holiday) so unable to print boarding cards and ended up having to pay 210 euros for 3 boarding cards at the airport. Completely ridiculous rule designed to make as much money out of us as possible. All other airlines allow you to print all boarding cards for your entire journey when you check-in online so can't understand why Ryanair don't. It should not be allowed. They lure you in with a cheap flight cost and charge you for everything else. I was really pleased when they announced they would have allocated seating on all flights which is much easier for those of us travelling with children so this should make it even easier to allocate a seat on return flight instead of making us customers with families having to pay at the airport for boarding cards.

1906,Gillian Magee,I have flown with Ryanair many times over the past 6 years and I have just two wishes. Firstly that they would stop being secretive about their latest scam and secondly if they continue to fly to Valencia they consider not changing flight details with such short notice. In March I booked some flights home from Alicante having read in their terms and conditions that they were changing the 14 day check in online to 30 days from April. However nowhere did it mention that they would be charging for the privilege or I most definitely would have booked easyjet who have had the free 30 day check in for sometime. In relation to Valencia flights they have two scheduled flights a week. In the past after disagreement with Valencia they just cancelled the whole route so I was pleased it recommenced even if it was from Manchester. They have now had to push the Monday flight back by half an hour and have given me 3 weeks notice of the change. It now lands at 11pm. Now that doesn't seem like a lot but unfortunately it has quite an impact cost wise as the majority of the car hire firms in Valencia close at 11 and therefore charge you 30-40 euros to open later. Sadly I'll have to now give up on Ryanair just when I think they were really trying hard. I have always followed the rules and never been disappointed with them to be honest you get what you pay for but I'm finally getting to old to try and stay ahead of their next money making change and 7 days check in is ridiculous so it's back to Easyjet.,Economy Class,n,2014-04-22,flown ryanair many time past year two wish firstly would stop secretive latest scam secondly continue fly valencia consider changing flight detail short notice march booked flight home alicante read term condition changing day check online day april however nowhere mention would charging privilege definitely would booked easyjet free day check sometime relation valencia flight two scheduled flight week past disagreement valencia cancelled whole route pleased recommenced even manchester push monday flight back half hour given week notice change land pm seem like lot unfortunately quite impact cost wise majority car hire firm valencia close therefore charge euro open later sadly give ryanair think really trying hard always followed rule never disappointed honest get pay finally getting old try stay ahead next money making change day check ridiculous back easyjet,0.1624,Neutral,872

1915,J Wilton,East Midlands to Tenerife 6th April FR3152. Returned 11th April FR3153. It's great to see that they are finally trying to improve customer service and it was definitely better on the way out. Having allocated seating now is much better although it was not clear when I booked that seats are allocated free at online check in so I unnecessarily paid £40 to do this in advance. Also what on earth is going on with the 'only the first 90 bags' can stay in the cabin idea? Great that you can now take a small bag (handbag laptop bag etc) and put it under your seat. However only the first 90 passengers are allowed to take a correctly sized and weighted wheeled case on board. At Tenerife they decided that everyone had to do this before they got on the plane and it was chaos with people trying to work out what they needed to take out. Strange also that they only pick on wheeled cases even small ones. My partner had a rucksack the contents of which were about the same weight as mine yet my bag was tagged for the hold. By the time I'd taken out all the valuables - camera iPad Kindle etc there was very little left in it. Also there was plenty of empty space on the overhead compartments once we got onboard. All completely pointless. I do think they are trying but they really don't think these things all the way through! All that is going to happen is that people's 2nd bags are gradually going to get larger and larger and there will be the same old rows at check in and the gate as there have always been! Other than that it's pretty good value for money I guess although I agree with other comments about flights times. Lots of them get into Stansted too late for the last trains which prevents me booking with them. Oh and the seats not reclining and no pocket for belongings continues to be tedious.

I do feel sorry for those who innocently don't pay enough attention to the very thorough pre flight reminders you always get sent. My flights are about 2.5 hours and that's fine but the seats are a tight fit and do not recline (I am not large but fellow passengers often are) so would not want to be onboard much longer than that. Aircraft's are in good nick and always clean and staff are generally friendly and helpful. Food is edible but only in an emergency! Coffee is fine and sensibly not served too hot. The lottery ticket sales used to grate but as they do fund deserving children's charities it is harsh to moan about that. Reliability on the route I use is excellent as is baggage handling.

We accept that this was our fault but I like to think this was human error. Again we accept that staff cannot be expected to spend hours printing off tickets for idiots!

No queue at the bag drop desk. Assigned seating is a nice new addition though boarding leaves much to be desired - flight departed 20 minutes late due the slightly slow boarding process which prompted some passengers to buy overpriced priority boarding from Ryanair staff hanging around the gate. Crew on board were professional and what I've noticed is that they smile and are happy to have friendly banter with passengers now - so that's a really added plus since my last trip! Seats not amazingly comfy but ok for the short flight. Arrived in Porto ahead of arrival time and bags were on the belt almost immediately (this is something good that hasn't changed!).

Check in even suggested throwing some clothing away to keep the weight down even though the same clothing weight had been ok on the outbound leg.

The web site wasn't too difficult and I was prompted by online live chat if I dallied they were helpful and reassured me only one booking had been made. Paid for hold luggage as I had a laptop bag as well. Reserved seats were welcome. I printed the boarding passes off before hand and arrived in plenty of time. Onboard reasonable bit garish and the selling wasn't too obnoxious given only a 50 min flight. Depart and arrive on time. So overall the experience wasn't too bad but then everything worked ok. The nagging feeling is what if it hadn't? But given the price you get what you pay for. Would I fly with them again? Given it was the only airline to that airport then yes.

Additionally Ryanair's new seat allocation policy appears to be at the expense of carrying on your hand luggage if your bag is not in the first 90 bags on board. Not only had I the inconvenience of lugging my case around the airport but had to wait for it in Bristol as it was taken off me as I boarded. Always 1 step forward and 2 back with Ryanair Easyjet is cheap and cheerful Ryanair is cheap and nasty.,Economy Class,n,2014-02-27,ryanair long way go improve service offer experienced appalling customer service flight bristol dublin th feb male steward took ryanair poor customer service new low extremely rude bad humoured swore front year old daughter additionally ryanair new seat allocation policy appears expense carrying hand luggage bag first bag board inconvenience lugging case around airport wait bristol taken boarded always step forward back ryanair easyjet cheap cheerful ryanair cheap nasty,-0.8363,Negative,474

1953,P Edwards,I fly on average once a fortnight with Ryanair and can't fault them. They get you from A to B on time and cheaply. You can still check in up to 15 days before the flight without having to pay for an allocated seat despite what they say. In fact if you are crafty you can actually choose your seat free of charge by doing the following: click on 'Choose a Seat' check which ones have already been allocated knowing that they allocate the seats in alternate rows front and back starting either side of the overwing exit rows. If you are happy with the next available seat then exit this page and click on 'Do not Choose Seat' and you will get that seat. If you are not happy with the location of the next available seat then exit check-in process altogether and try again later.

1954,P Ward,Feb 14 MAN-Paphos. This is the most budget airline I have come across I became paranoid about the weight of my luggage! Thankfully we were within the guidelines however on arrival to the gate (2 Ryanair) employees were waiting to pounce scrutinising everyone's hand luggage and asking them to place their cabin bags in the frame. Lucky for us we were OK but numerous passengers who 'could not fit' theirs were made to pay £50 which were then put in the hold. Why did the check in staff not ask to weigh their cabin bags at check in - in my opinion this is the way they make an extra £50 per passenger - some cheap flight for these unfortunate people (students) many of whom were going home for half term and short of money to begin with - for me never again. Ryanair have no PR skills whatsoever this is a complete lack of training in every area of customer service.,Economy Class,n,2014-02-25,feb man paphos budget airline come across became paranoid weight luggage thankfully within guideline however arrival gate ryanair employee waiting pounce scrutinising everyone hand luggage asking place cabin bag frame lucky u ok numerous passenger could fit made pay put hold check staff ask weigh cabin bag check opinion way make extra per passenger cheap flight unfortunate people student many going home half term short money begin never ryanair pr skill whatsoever complete lack training every area customer service,0.7003,Positive,519

However I've just noticed that I can only check in online 7 days before the flights unless I buy a pre-allocated seat. Because of my flight times this means I will have to find a place to print out my boarding pass while away.

1966,T Jackson,Have flown MAN - DUB - MAN/LBA bi-monthly with Ryanair and have been very impressed every single time. First of all a flight 2 weeks in advance from the booking date for £9.99 one way can not be denied this is a brilliant price for an on-time flight on a virtually brand new 737-800. The one gripe I'd have is the allocated seating (something that most airlines use effectively). As a frequent FR traveller I pick the same seat every time unfortunately the common sense of booking and then finding your seat seems to have evaded some people as it turned into some chaos - so I'd advise to still get on the aircraft towards the front. Other than that I'm extremely happy to fly Ryanair again and again as the on-time no-frills cheap flights will always be too good to turn down! Follow the rules and you will certainly enjoy your flight.,Economy Class,y,2014-02-07,flown man dub man lba bi monthly ryanair impressed every single time first flight week advance booking date one way denied brilliant price time flight virtually brand new one gripe allocated seating something airline use effectively frequent fr traveller pick seat every time unfortunately common sense booking finding seat seems evaded people turned chaos advise still get aircraft towards front extremely happy fly ryanair time frill cheap flight always good turn follow rule certainly enjoy flight,0.923,Positive,500

1968,N Holdsworth,First experience of Ryanair's new self proclaimed 'industry leading customer service'. Stansted to Tampere out 31st Jan return 3rd Feb. The allocated seating (on the return leg) was a big improvement. The seats are still bolt upright but at 6ft 3 I've never found the legroom to be that bad. This leaves us with the migrane inducing yellow the bright cabin lights and the constant procession of scratchcard sales and frankly annoying announcements about the still overpriced microwave food to moan about. They seem to have at least stopped the irritating soft drink adverts on replay. I guess Ryanair are an option if they are flying where you want to actually go but my own conclusion - as a relatively frequent flyer - is that there is no point in saving a little bit of money if it costs you a lot of time and hassle which on this trip it still did.,Economy Class,y,2014-02-04,first experience ryanair new self proclaimed industry leading customer service stansted tampere st jan return rd feb allocated seating return leg big improvement seat still bolt upright ft never found legroom bad leaf u migrane inducing yellow bright cabin light constant procession scratchcard sale frankly annoying announcement still overpriced microwave food moan seem least stopped irritating soft drink advert replay guess ryanair option flying want actually go conclusion relatively frequent flyer point saving little bit money cost lot time hassle trip still,0.5293,Positive,565

Stood for an hour at Edinburgh check in then another 45 minutes at the gate in the hope my wife and I would get a seat together (why should we pay extra for this?). On board is a joke leg room and general scope of the seating is ridiculous. All cabin crew were rude and only wanted to sell things. We heard about the seat belt signs coming on for turbulence just before the trolleys come out and sure enough this happened twice on the way out and back apparently an old Ryanair trick. Return check in at Tenerife was ridiculous 5 Ryanair flights being checked in at one time through 3 desks that's nearly 700 passengers. No Ryanair staff on duty and no one is interested in what you have to say. Usual stampede for seats together again why should we pay for that privilege? Its standard with everyone else.

1982,Z Beckett,FR555/552 Manchester-Dublin 30/12/13-02/01/14. I fly quite a few times a year but this was my first time with Ryanair so I was interested to compare. I have to say if you follow the rules that are made very clear to you well before departure you will have no problems. There were a few people who hadn't printed boarding passes or their cases were far too big for the cabin and they were moaning about being charged to check them in etc. Yes the fees for printing are totally ridiculous for printing a sheet of paper but just don't get yourself in that situation! I had booked an exit row seat for an extra £10 which included priority boarding. I have to say it was worth it especially being tall. I arrived at the gate 45 minutes before the departure time to see a huge queue waiting for the boarding to start. The priority boarding queue was empty so I walked straight down and waited for around 15 minutes. Then a member of staff came over and said would you like to come forward we are ready after my pass was checked the barrier for the others was opened. I boarded the plane first after a few minutes wait at the bottom of the stairs of the plane and got settled whilst everyone else boarded. I'm not sure if this system works if there is a bus to catch to the plane? One benefit of being nearer to the front of the queue is getting seats with family/friends and having space to store luggage as many people we struggling to find places for their luggage once the plane was filling up. The flight was comfortable and crew were fairly friendly but seemed in a rush to serve drinks and were quite sharp with a few customers who were asking for a drink of water. The people in front were drinking their own alcohol and were sharply told that they couldn't consume their own alcohol on board. Overall I found the experience far better than expected even though the service of other airlines isn't present but the price was far far lower!

1984,Mark Wroblewski,My last trip with Ryanair was Modlin-Hahn-Modlin at the beginning of December 2013. Both flights were excellent. Each time I'm in Europe I indulge myself in city hopping. It's only possible thanks to Ryanair's prices. You get what you have paid for: Affordable and safe transport from A to B. Pros: Price modern planes efficient and friendly cabin crew.

1985,A Green,Ryanair never cease to plunge to new depths in customer experience. Always looking for a new way to con passengers into falling foul of a regulation so they can extort money to bring their cheap fares in to line with the proper airlines. This time we made sure we packed a bag within the regulations got priority boarding and then had a rude stewardess snap at us to remove the bag and coats from the over head locker to make room for (oversized) late boarders bags - then try and take my bag into the hold!,Economy Class,n,2013-12-29,ryanair never cease plunge new depth customer experience always looking new way con passenger falling foul regulation extort money bring cheap fare line proper airline time made sure packed bag within regulation got priority boarding rude stewardess snap u remove bag coat head locker make room oversized late boarder bag try take bag hold,-0.3182,Negative,339
1986,Mark Farrelly,"Travel monthly Liverpool to Dublin the most recent the flight from Liverpool could not land due to storm force winds. The 3.20pm flight eventually left at 10.20pm - 5 euro refreshment voucher. We queued for the flight at 7.05pm but that was cancelled for technical reasons. Passengers were offered transfers to flights to Manchester or Birmingham or the 10.20pm flight. I suppose not their fault but instead of asking passengers who wanted to go to Manchester to go to one desk and the others at another desk I was told ""first come first served"". Strange thing was the late flight could cater for all the passengers who were going to Liverpool so the technical fault saved them a flight to Liverpool. The 10.20pm flight was a nightmare with about twenty males all drunk and swearing and having to be advised by cabin staff to behave to be fair there was no alcohol sold on the flight. I will continue to use Ryanair as they are cheap but when possible travel on early morning flights you miss the stag/hen/football fans. I am looking forward to the allocation of seats so no more stampedes for the departure gates and they are only doing what Easyjet and Aer Lingus currently do.

1988,P Batista,Today Sunday 22/12/2013 I arrived at Manchester airport terminal 3 at 6.30pm. I was surprised by a big queue I was in that queue for about 10 minutes without moving anywhere a member of staff comes up and says (ladies and gentlemen we are evacuating to terminal 1 for security reasons) so I thought I was going to be late. I asked this gentlemen who said not to worry as all flights were delayed. When we got to terminal 1 after 10 minutes nothing had been said I went to see a member of staff and asked for information. I was told to sit and wait until I get a call. At 9.00 pm I went and asked again and I was told to wait 5 minutes later a lady came to me and asked if I was flying to Faro ans was told to follow her. There was when I found out I had missed the flight my plane had taken off at 7.45 pm.

1992,Carl Trigg,My girlfriend and I arrived early and were treated to a lengthy queue at Stansted before a manic rush for seats ensued. Does the company not realise that not allocating seats will cause this? It flares up tempers and causes the whole plane load of passengers to be angry from the start. I stored my hand luggage in the overhead compartment and when I eventually got (semi) comfortable in my tiny seat I was asked by the cabin crew to move my bag from the overhead compartment to under my seat. I am 6.5ft tall and I explained this to the cabin crew that I would not have any room for my legs if I did this. Both the outgoing and return journeys were the same with absolutely no comfort whatsoever and incessant adverts being played to us offering to sell e-cigs or take part in exciting competitions. Any food on offer was overpriced. The return flight from Venice (the out of town airport) was akin to my Army days in Northern Ireland. Normally reasonable people cooped up like battery hens in a hot and stuffy room forced to stand for 2 hours waiting for Ryanair to sort their act out. After 2 hours the queue system we have ourselves put in place started to crumble and people began to flare up. Once the doors opened it was literally a stampede. Dozens of angry sweaty people paying for the privilege of running a race. I was exhausted by the experience. They have absolutely no regard for your comfort or well being.,Economy Class,n,2013-12-17,girlfriend arrived early treated lengthy queue stansted manic rush seat ensued company realise allocating seat cause flare temper cause whole plane load passenger angry start stored hand luggage overhead compartment eventually got semi comfortable tiny seat asked cabin crew move bag overhead compartment seat ft tall explained cabin crew would room leg outgoing return journey absolutely comfort whatsoever incessant advert played u offering sell e cigs take part exciting competition food offer overpriced return flight venice town airport akin army day northern ireland normally reasonable people cooped like battery hen hot stuffy room forced stand hour waiting ryanair sort act hour queue system put place started crumble people began flare door opened literally stampede dozen angry sweaty people paying privilege running race exhausted experience absolutely regard comfort well,0.8193,Positive,884
1993,Tsagkalidis Nikolaos,The first time I travelled with Ryanair my problem was that they were trying to find a way to make you pay 50 euros for your bag because it would not fit in their box so I paid them the 50 euros. Second time I bought extra baggage so to be in the clear. I Flew from Thessaloniki to Milan and it was ok they were still looking at your hands for luggage trying to find a way to charge you with something. On the way back from Milan to Thessaloniki I arrived at the gate at 7.10am (due to a general strike in Milan + an accident on the road) the plane was leaving at 7.25 am despite the fact I told that I was delayed due to unforeseen circumstances the pilot refused to board the plane 15 minutes before take off.,Economy Class,n,2013-12-17,first time travelled ryanair problem trying find way make pay euro bag would fit box paid euro second time bought extra baggage clear flew thessaloniki milan ok still looking hand luggage trying find way charge something way back milan thessaloniki arrived gate due general strike milan accident road plane leaving despite fact told delayed due unforeseen circumstance pilot refused board plane minute take,0.3107,Neutral,406
1994,D Whyte,Day trip to Bremen 10th December from Stansted. As ever Ryanair was punctual and efficient. It is a flying bus from A to B. There is no ceremony involved. Ryanair has a couple of simple rules about baggage and to have your boarding pass before you arrive. If you can't arrange something as simple as printing out a piece of paper and complain that you have to pay for luggage on top of your massively cheap air ticket to begin with then just don't fly with these people. I'm off to Morocco next from Stansted for less than £70 return. One small backpack well within the limits with a few pairs of jeans and some T-shirts rolled up neatly folded up colour printed boarding passes and remembering to sit on the right hand side of the aircraft to avoid the sun blazing through the window for the morning flight.,Economy Class,y,2013-12-16,day trip bremen th december stansted ever ryanair punctual efficient flying bus b ceremony involved ryanair couple simple rule baggage boarding pas arrive arrange something simple printing piece paper complain pay luggage top massively cheap air ticket begin fly people morocco next stansted le return one small backpack well within limit pair jean shirt rolled neatly folded colour printed boarding pass remembering sit right hand side aircraft avoid sun blazing window morning flight,0.7351,Positive,485

1996,Neil Harvey,"Tenerife to Manchester. Flight left on time and arrived 5 minutes early which they brag about on landing. Heavy landing at Manchester and hard braking as I believe there is an ""early turn off"" on the runway to allow them to get the gate faster and offloaded/onloaded quicker? First time I have used them for a while and the gaudy yellow and blue cabin interior is a bit hard on the eyes but the crew were friendly and efficient and the legroom and leather seats were better than the Monarch flight we flew down on.

1998,Richard Lateano,The bad press surrounding Ryanair proved to be totally unjustified on my round trip Madrid-Cagliari-Madrid. Check- in and security was the quickest and most polite ever (especially at the dedicated check-in/security at Madrid. Boarding was orderly and uneventful (both in Madrid and Cagliari).

1999,R Boy,We returned from Gran Canaria to Stansted on the delayed flight (by 2 hours 20 min) on 7/8 December. The passenger next to me was drunk (shouting and carrying on) when he got on the plane. He then drank at least 10 miniature Bacardis and Pepsi supplied enthusiastically by cabin staff. Mercifully he fell asleep but did not fasten his seat belt during landing although he then stood up while the plane was still moving quite fast. There was no inspection of seat belts by cabin staff before landing nor was he told to sit down. Our seats were near the emergency door where passengers are supposed to assist with evacuation. He was a big man who was in no state to assist and would have been a serious hindrance if there had been an emergency. Clearly the policy of the cabin staff is to sell as much booze as possible and not bother with basic safety or the comfort of other passengers.,Economy Class,n,2013-12-09,returned gran canaria stansted delayed flight hour min december passenger next drunk shouting carrying got plane drank least miniature bacardis pepsi supplied enthusiastically cabin staff mercifully fell asleep fasten seat belt landing although stood plane still moving quite fast inspection seat belt cabin staff landing told sit seat near emergency door passenger supposed assist evacuation big man state assist would serious hindrance emergency clearly policy cabin staff sell much booze possible bother basic safety comfort passenger,-0.3182,Negative,537
